This is important, if you decide to use a proxy within Docker. IMPORTANT: Do not use port 8081, 9081 or 65510! Recreate affected containers by running docker-compose up -d . Important information, please read them carefully! Info If you plan to use a reverse proxy and want to use another server name that is not MAILCOW_HOSTNAME, you need to read Adding additional server names for mailcow UI at the bottom of this page. Warning Make sure you run generate_config.sh before you enable any site configuration examples below. The script generate_config.sh copies snake-oil certificates to the correct location, so the services will not fail to start due to missing files. Warning If you enable TLS SNI ( ENABLE_TLS_SNI in mailcow.conf), the certificate paths in your reverse proxy must match the correct paths in data/assets/ssl/{hostname}. The certificates will be split into data/assets/ssl/{hostname1,hostname2,etc} and therefore will not work when you copy the examples from below pointing to data/assets/ssl/cert.pem etc. Info Using the site configs below will forward ACME requests to mailcow and let it handle certificates itself. The downside of using mailcow as ACME client behind a reverse proxy is, that you will need to reload your webserver after acme-mailcow changed/renewed/created the certificate. You can either reload your webserver daily or write a script to watch the file for changes. On many servers logrotate will reload the webserver daily anyway. If you want to use a local certbot installation, you will need to change the SSL certificate parameters accordingly. Make sure you run a post-hook script when you decide to use external ACME clients.

Important : This config only covers the \"reverseproxing\" of the webpannel (nginx-mailcow) using Traefik v2, if you also want to reverseproxy the mail services such as dovecot, postfix... you'll just need to adapt the following config to each container and create an EntryPoint on your traefik.toml or traefik.yml (depending which config you use) for each port. For this section we'll assume you have your Traefik 2 [certificatesresolvers] properly configured on your traefik configuration file, and also using acme, also, the following example uses Lets Encrypt, but feel free to change it to your own cert resolver. You can find a basic Traefik 2 toml config file with all the above implemented which can be used for this example here traefik.toml if you need one, or a hint on how to adapt your config. So, first of all, we are going to disable the acme-mailcow container since we'll use the certs that traefik will provide us. For this we'll have to set SKIP_LETS_ENCRYPT=y on our mailcow.conf , and run docker-compose up -d to apply the changes.

This container will watch over the acme.json file for any changes, and regenerate the cert.pem and key.pem files directly into data/assets/ssl/ being the path binded to the container's /output path.

If it succeeds, a name will be added as SAN to the certificate request. Only names that can be validated, will be added as SAN.

It is not possible to keep domains in a certificate, when we are not able validate the challenge for those.

Validation errors and how to skip validation \u00b6 You can skip the IP verification by setting SKIP_IP_CHECK=y in mailcow.conf (no quotes). Be warned that a misconfiguration will get you ratelimited by Let's Encrypt! This is primarily useful for multi-IP setups where the IP check would return the incorrect source IP address. Due to using dynamic IPs for acme-mailcow, source NAT is not consistent over restarts. If you encounter problems with \"HTTP validation\", but your IP address confirmation succeeds, you are most likely using firewalld, ufw or any other firewall, that disallows connections from br-mailcow to your external interface. Both firewalld and ufw disallow this by default. It is often not enough to just stop these firewall services. You'd need to stop mailcow ( docker-compose down ), stop the firewall service, flush the chains and restart Docker. You can also skip this validation method by setting SKIP_HTTP_VERIFICATION=y in \"mailcow.conf\". Be warned that this is discouraged. In most cases, the HTTP verification is skipped to workaround unknown NAT reflection issues, which are not resolved by ignoring this specific network misconfiguration. If you encounter problems generating TLSA records in the DNS overview within mailcow, you are most likely having issues with NAT reflection you should fix. If you changed a SKIP_* parameter, run docker-compose up -d to apply your changes. Disable Let's Encrypt \u00b6 Disable Let's Encrypt completely \u00b6 Set SKIP_LETS_ENCRYPT=y in \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker-compose up -d . Skip all names but ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} \u00b6 Add ONLY_MAILCOW_HOSTNAME=y to \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker-compose up -d . The Let's Encrypt subjectAltName limit of 100 domains \u00b6 Let's Encrypt currently has a limit of 100 Domain Names per Certificate . By default, \"acme-mailcow\" will create a single SAN certificate for all validated domains (see the first section and Additional domain names ). This provides best compatibility but means the Let's Encrypt limit exceeds if you add too many domains to a single mailcow installation. To solve this, you can configure ENABLE_SSL_SNI to generate: A main server certificate with MAILCOW_HOSTNAME and all fully qualified domain names in the ADDITIONAL_SAN config One additional certificate for each domain found in the database with autodiscover. , autoconfig. and any other ADDITIONAL_SAN configured in this format (subdomain.*). Limitations: A certificate name ADDITIONAL_SAN=test.example.com will be added as SAN to the main certificate. A separate certificate/key pair will not be generated for this format. Postfix, Dovecot and Nginx will then serve these certificates with SNI. Set ENABLE_SSL_SNI=y in \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker-compose up -d . Warning Not all clients support SNI, see Dovecot documentation or Wikipedia . You should make sure these clients use the MAILCOW_HOSTNAME for secure connections if you enable this feature. Here is an example: MAILCOW_HOSTNAME=server.email.tld ADDITIONAL_SAN=webmail.email.tld,mail.* Mailcow email domains: \"domain1.tld\" and \"domain2.tld\" The following certificates will be generated: server.email.tld, webmail.email.tld -> this is the default certificate, all clients can connect with these domains mail.domain1.tld, autoconfig.domain1.tld, autodiscover.domain1.tld -> individual certificate for domain1.tld, cannot be used by clients without SNI support mail.domain2.tld, autoconfig.domain2.tld, autodiscover.domain2.tld -> individual certificate for domain2.tld, cannot be used by clients without SNI support How to use your own certificate \u00b6 Make sure you disable mailcows internal LE client (see above). To use your own certificates, just save the combined certificate (containing the certificate and intermediate CA/CA if any) to data/assets/ssl/cert.pem and the corresponding key to data/assets/ssl/key.pem . IMPORTANT: Do not use symbolic links! Make sure you copy the certificates and do not link them to data/assets/ssl . Restart affected services afterwards: docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=postfix-mailcow) docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=nginx-mailcow) docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=dovecot-mailcow) See Post-hook script for non-mailcow ACME clients for a full example script. Test against staging ACME directory \u00b6 Edit mailcow.conf and add LE_STAGING=y . Run docker-compose up -d to activate your changes. Custom directory URL \u00b6 Edit mailcow.conf and add the corresponding directory URL to the new variable DIRECTORY_URL : DIRECTORY_URL=https://acme-custom-v9000.api.letsencrypt.org/directory You cannot use LE_STAGING with DIRECTORY_URL . If both are set, only LE_STAGING is used. Run docker-compose up -d to activate your changes. Check your configuration \u00b6 Run docker-compose logs acme-mailcow to find out why a validation fails. To check if nginx serves the correct certificate, simply use a browser of your choice and check the displayed certificate. To check the certificate served by Postfix, Dovecot and Nginx we will use openssl : # Connect via SMTP (587) echo \"Q\" | openssl s_client -starttls smtp -crlf -connect mx.mailcow.email:587 # Connect via IMAP (143) echo \"Q\" | openssl s_client -starttls imap -showcerts -connect mx.mailcow.email:143 # Connect via HTTPS (443) echo \"Q\" | openssl s_client -connect mx.mailcow.email:443 To validate the expiry dates as returned by openssl against MAILCOW_HOSTNAME, you are able to use our helper script: cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized bash helper-scripts/expiry-dates.sh","title":"Advanced SSL"},{"location":"firststeps-ssl/#lets-encrypt-out-of-the-box","text":"The \"acme-mailcow\" container will try to obtain a LE certificate for ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} , autodiscover.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN and autoconfig.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN .

See more in the Reverse Proxy documentation. By default, which means 0 domains are added to mailcow, it will try to obtain a certificate for ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} . For each domain you add, it will try to resolve autodiscover.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN and autoconfig.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN to its IPv6 address or - if IPv6 is not configured in your domain - IPv4 address. If it succeeds, a name will be added as SAN to the certificate request. Only names that can be validated, will be added as SAN. For every domain you remove, the certificate will be moved and a new certificate will be requested. It is not possible to keep domains in a certificate, when we are not able validate the challenge for those.

Due to using dynamic IPs for acme-mailcow, source NAT is not consistent over restarts. If you encounter problems with \"HTTP validation\", but your IP address confirmation succeeds, you are most likely using firewalld, ufw or any other firewall, that disallows connections from br-mailcow to your external interface. Both firewalld and ufw disallow this by default. It is often not enough to just stop these firewall services. You'd need to stop mailcow ( docker-compose down ), stop the firewall service, flush the chains and restart Docker. You can also skip this validation method by setting SKIP_HTTP_VERIFICATION=y in \"mailcow.conf\". Be warned that this is discouraged. In most cases, the HTTP verification is skipped to workaround unknown NAT reflection issues, which are not resolved by ignoring this specific network misconfiguration.

It is highly recommended to use the commands below to install docker-compose . Package managers (e.g. apt , yum ) likely won't give you the latest version. Note: This command downloads docker-compose from the official Docker Github repository and is a safe method. The snippet will determine the latest supported version by mailcow. In almost all cases this is the latest version available (exceptions are broken releases or major changes not yet supported by mailcow). curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -Ls https://www.servercow.de/docker-compose/latest.php)/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Please use the latest Docker engine available and do not use the engine that ships with your distros repository. 1.1. On SELinux enabled systems, e.g. CentOS 7: Check if \"container-selinux\" package is present on your system: rpm -qa | grep container-selinux If the above command returns an empty or no output, you should install it via your package manager. Check if docker has SELinux support enabled: docker info | grep selinux If the above command returns an empty or no output, create or edit /etc/docker/daemon.json and add \"selinux-enabled\": true . Example file content: { \"selinux-enabled\": true } Restart the docker daemon and verify SELinux is now enabled. This step is required to make sure mailcows volumes are properly labeled as declared in the compose file. If you are interested in how this works, you can check out the readme of https://github.com/containers/container-selinux which links to a lot of useful information on that topic. 2. Clone the master branch of the repository, make sure your umask equals 0022. Please clone the repository as root user and also control the stack as root. We will modify attributes - if necessary - while boostrapping the containers automatically and make sure everything is secured. The update.sh script must therefore also be run as root. It might be necessary to change ownership and other attributes of files you will otherwise not have access to. We drop permissions for every exposed application and will not run an exposed service as root! Controlling the Docker daemon as non-root user does not give you additional security. The unprivileged user will spawn the containers as root likewise. The behaviour of the stack is identical. $ su # umask 0022 # <- Verify it is 0022 # cd /opt # git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized # cd mailcow-dockerized 3. Generate a configuration file. Use a FQDN ( host.domain.tld ) as hostname when asked. ./generate_config.sh 4. Change configuration if you want or need to. nano mailcow.conf If you plan to use a reverse proxy, you can, for example, bind HTTPS to 127.0.0.1 on port 8443 and HTTP to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080. You may need to stop an existing pre-installed MTA which blocks port 25/tcp. See this chapter to learn how to reconfigure Postfix to run besides mailcow after a successful installation. Some updates modify mailcow.conf and add new parameters. It is hard to keep track of them in the documentation. Please check their description and, if unsure, ask at the known channels for advise. 4.1. Users with a MTU not equal to 1500 (e.g. OpenStack): Whenever you run into trouble and strange phenomena, please check your MTU. Edit docker-compose.yml and change the network settings according to your MTU. Add the new driver_opts parameter like this: networks: mailcow-network: ... driver_opts: com.docker.network.driver.mtu: 1450 ... 4.2. Users without an IPv6 enabled network on their host system: Enable IPv6. Finally. If you do not have an IPv6 enabled network on your host and you don't care for a better internet (thehe), it is recommended to disable IPv6 for the mailcow network to prevent unforeseen issues. 5. Pull the images and run the compose file. The parameter -d will start mailcow: dockerized detached: docker-compose pull docker-compose up -d Done! You can now access https://${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} with the default credentials admin + password moohoo . Info If you are not using mailcow behind a reverse proxy, you should redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS . The database will be initialized right after a connection to MySQL can be established.

Due to it's deduplication capabilities you can store a great number of backups without wasting large amounts of disk space. This allows you to run backups in very short intervals to ensure minimal data loss when the need arises to recover data from a backup. This document guides you through the process to enable continuous backups for mailcow with borgmatic. The borgmatic functionality is provided by the borgmatic Docker image by b3vis . Check out the README in that repository to find out about the other options (such as push notifications) that are available. This guide only covers the basics. Setting up borgmatic \u00b6 Create or amend docker-compose.override.yml \u00b6 In the mailcow-dockerized root folder create or edit docker-compose.override.yml and insert the following configuration: version : '2.1' services : borgmatic-mailcow : image : b3vis/borgmatic restart : always dns : ${IPV4_NETWORK:-172.22.1}.254 volumes : - vmail-vol-1:/mnt/source/vmail:ro - mysql-socket-vol-1:/var/run/mysqld/:z - ./data/conf/borgmatic/etc:/etc/borgmatic.d:Z - ./data/conf/borgmatic/state:/root/.config/borg:Z - ./data/conf/borgmatic/ssh:/root/.ssh:Z environment : - TZ=${TZ} - BORG_PASSPHRASE=YouBetterPutSomethingRealGoodHere networks : mailcow-network : aliases : - borgmatic Ensure that you change the BORG_PASSPHRASE to a secure passphrase of your choosing. For security reasons we mount the maildir as read-only. If you later want to restore data you will need to remove the ro flag prior to restoring the data. This is described in the section on restoring backups. Create data/conf/borgmatic/etc/config.yaml \u00b6 Next, we need to create the borgmatic configuration. source mailcow.conf cat <<EOF > data/conf/borgmatic/etc/config.yaml location: source_directories: - /mnt/source repositories: - user@rsync.net:mailcow remote_path: borg1 retention: keep_hourly: 24 keep_daily: 7 keep_weekly: 4 keep_monthly: 6 hooks: mysql_databases: - name: ${DBNAME} username: ${DBUSER} password: ${DBPASS} options: --default-character-set=utf8mb4 EOF Creating the file in this way ensures the correct MySQL credentials are pulled in from mailcow.conf . This file is a minimal example for using borgmatic with an account user on the cloud storage provider rsync.net for a repository called mailcow (see repositories setting). It will backup both the maildir and MySQL database, which is all you should need to restore your mailcow setup after an incident. The retention settings will keep one archive for each hour of the past 24 hours, one per day of the week, one per week of the month and one per month of the past half year. Check the borgmatic documentation on how to use other types of repositories or configuration options. If you choose to use a local filesystem as a backup destination make sure to mount it into the container. The container defines a volume called /mnt/borg-repository for this purpose. Note If you do not use rsync.net you can most likely drop the remote_path element from your config. Create a crontab \u00b6 Create a new text file in data/conf/borgmatic/etc/crontab.txt with the following content: 14 * * * * PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/bin/borgmatic --stats -v 0 2>&1 This file expects crontab syntax. The example shown here will trigger the backup to run every hour at 14 minutes past the hour and log some nice stats at the end. Place SSH keys in folder \u00b6 Place the SSH keys you intend to use for remote repository connections in data/conf/borgmatic/ssh . OpenSSH expects the usual id_rsa , id_ed25519 or similar to be in this directory. Ensure the file is chmod 600 and not world readable or OpenSSH will refuse to use the SSH key. Bring up the container \u00b6 For the next step we need the container to be up and running in a configured state. To do that run: docker-compose up -d Initialize the repository \u00b6 By now your borgmatic container is up and running, but the backups will currently fail due to the repository not being initialized. To initialize the repository run: docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic init --encryption repokey-blake2 You will be asked you to authenticate the SSH host key of your remote repository server. See if it matches and confirm the prompt by entering yes . The repository will be initialized with the passphrase you set in the BORG_PASSPHRASE environment variable earlier. When using any of the repokey encryption methods the encryption key will be stored in the repository itself and not on the client, so there is no further action required in this regard. If you decide to use a keyfile instead of a repokey make sure you export the key and back it up separately. Check the Exporting Keys section for how to retrieve the key. Restart container \u00b6 Now that we finished configuring and initializing the repository restart the container to ensure it is in a defined state: docker-compose restart borgmatic-mailcow Restoring from a backup \u00b6 Restoring a backup assumes you are starting off with a fresh installation of mailcow, and you currently do not have any custom data in your maildir or your mailcow database. Restore maildir \u00b6 Warning Doing this will overwrite files in your maildir! Do not run this unless you actually intend to recover mail files from a backup. If you use SELinux in Enforcing mode If you are using mailcow on a host with SELinux in Enforcing mode you will have to temporarily disable it during extraction of the archive as the mailcow setup labels the vmail volume as private, belonging to the dovecot container exclusively. SELinux will (rightfully) prevent any other container, such as the borgmatic container, from writing to this volume. Before running a restore you must make the vmail volume writeable in docker-compose.override.yml by removing the ro flag from the volume. Then you can use the following command to restore the maildir from a backup: docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic extract --path mnt/source --archive latest Alternatively you can specify any archive name from the list of archives (see Listing all available archives ) Restore MySQL \u00b6 Warning Running this command will delete and recreate the mailcow database! Do not run this unless you actually intend to recover the mailcow database from a backup. To restore the MySQL database from the latest archive use this command: docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic restore --archive latest Alternatively you can specify any archive name from the list of archives (see Listing all available archives ) After restoring \u00b6 After restoring you need to restart mailcow. If you disabled SELinux enforcing mode now would be a good time to re-enable it. To restart mailcow use the follwing command: docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d If you use SELinux this will also trigger the re-labeling of all files in your vmail volume. Be patient, as this may take a while if you have lots of files. Useful commands \u00b6 Manual archiving run (with debugging output) \u00b6 docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic -v 2 Listing all available archives \u00b6 docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic list Break lock \u00b6 When borg is interrupted during an archiving run it will leave behind a stale lock that needs to be cleared before any new operations can be performed: docker-compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borg break-lock user@rsync.net:mailcow Where user@rsync.net:mailcow is the URI to your repository. Now would be a good time to do a manual archiving run to ensure it can be successfully performed. Exporting keys \u00b6 When using any of the keyfile methods for encryption you MUST take care of backing up the key files yourself. The key files are generated when you initialize the repository. The repokey methods store the key file within the repository, so a manual backup isn't as essential. Note that in either case you also must have the passphrase to decrypt any archives.

Example: GOGS_SSH_PORT=127.0.0.1:4000 5. Run docker-compose up -d to bring up the Gogs container and run docker-compose restart nginx-mailcow afterwards. 6. Open http://${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME}/gogs/ , for example http://mx.example.org/gogs/ . For database details set mysql as database host. Use the value of DBNAME found in mailcow.conf as database name, DBUSER as database user and DBPASS as database password. 7. Once the installation is complete, login as admin and set \"settings\" -> \"authorization\" -> \"enable SMTP\". SMTP Host should be postfix with port 587 , set Skip TLS Verify as we are using an unlisted SAN (\"postfix\" is most likely not part of your certificate). 8. Create data/gogs/gogs/conf/app.ini and set following values. You can consult Gogs cheat sheet for their meaning and other possible values. [server] SSH_LISTEN_PORT = 22 # For GOGS_SSH_PORT=127.0.0.1:4000 in mailcow.conf, set: SSH_DOMAIN = 127.0.0.1 SSH_PORT = 4000 # For MAILCOW_HOSTNAME=mx.example.org in mailcow.conf (and default ports for HTTPS), set: ROOT_URL = https://mx.example.org/gogs/ 9. Restart Gogs with docker-compose restart gogs-mailcow . Your users should be able to login with mailcow managed accounts.","title":"Gogs"},{"location":"third_party-mailpiler_integration/","text":"This is a simple integration of mailcow aliases and the mailbox name into mailpiler when using IMAP authentication. Disclaimer : This is not officially maintained nor supported by the mailcow project nor its contributors. No warranty or support is being provided, however you're free to open issues on GitHub for filing a bug or provide further ideas. GitHub repo can be found here . Info Support for domain wildcards were implemented in Piler 1.3.10 which was released on 03.01.2021. Prior versions basically do work, but after logging in you won't see emails sent from or to the domain alias. (e.g. when @example.com is an alias for admin@example.com ) The problem to solve \u00b6 mailpiler offers the authentication based on IMAP, for example: $config['ENABLE_IMAP_AUTH'] = 1; $config['IMAP_HOST'] = 'mail.example.com'; $config['IMAP_PORT'] = 993; $config['IMAP_SSL'] = true; So when you log in using patrik@example.com , you will only see delivered emails sent from or to this specific email address. When additional aliases are defined in mailcow, like team@example.com , you won't see emails sent to or from this email address even the fact you're a recipient of mails sent to this alias address. By hooking into the authentication process of mailpiler, we are able to get required data via the mailcow API during login. This fires API requests to the mailcow API (requiring read-only API access) to read out the aliases your email address participates and also the \"Name\" of the mailbox specified to display it on the top-right of mailpiler after login. Permitted email addresses can be seen in the mailpiler settings top-right after logging in. Info This is only pulled once during the authentication process. The authorized aliases and the realname are valid for the whole duration of the user session as mailpiler sets them in the session data. If user is removed from specific alias, this will only take effect after next login. The solution \u00b6 Note: File paths might vary depending on your setup.

U2F and Yubi OTP support multiple keys per user. As the third TFA method mailcow uses TOTP: time-based one-time passwords. Those passwords can be generated with apps like \"Google Authenticator\" after initially scanning a QR code or entering the given secret manually.

Learn Spam & Ham \u00b6 Rspamd learns mail as spam or ham when you move a message in or out of the junk folder to any mailbox besides trash. This is achieved by using the Sieve plugin \"sieve_imapsieve\" and parser scripts. Rspamd also auto-learns mail when a high or low score is detected (see https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/statistic.html#autolearning ). We configured the plugin to keep a sane ratio between spam and ham learns. The bayes statistics are written to Redis as keys BAYES_HAM and BAYES_SPAM . Besides bayes, a local fuzzy storage is used to learn recurring patterns in text or images that indicate ham or spam. You can also use Rspamd's web UI to learn ham and / or spam or to adjust certain settings of Rspamd. Learn Spam or Ham from existing directory \u00b6 You can use a one-liner to learn mail in plain-text (uncompressed) format: # Ham for file in /my/folder/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker-compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_ham < $file ; done # Spam for file in /my/folder/.Junk/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker-compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_spam < $file ; done Consider attaching a local folder as new volume to rspamd-mailcow in docker-compose.yml and learn given files inside the container. This can be used as workaround to parse compressed data with zcat. Example: for file in /data/old_mail/.Junk/cur/* ; do rspamc learn_spam < zcat $file ; done Reset learned data (Bayes, Neural) \u00b6 You need to delete keys in Redis to reset learned data, so create a copy of your Redis database now: Backup database # It is better to stop Redis before you copy the file. cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/mailcowdockerized_redis-vol-1/_data/dump.rdb /root/ Reset Bayes data docker-compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern BAYES_* | xargs redis-cli del' docker-compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern RS* | xargs redis-cli del' Reset Neural data docker-compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern rn_* | xargs redis-cli del' Reset Fuzzy data # We need to enter the redis-cli first: docker-compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli # In redis-cli: 127 .0.0.1:6379> EVAL \"for i, name in ipairs(redis.call('KEYS', ARGV[1])) do redis.call('DEL', name); end\" 0 fuzzy* Info If redis-cli complains about...

While the above works for rejected mails with a high spam score, prefilter reject actions will ignore this setting.

Using a public resolver like Googles 4x8, OpenDNS or any other shared DNS resolver like your ISPs will hit that limit very soon.","title":"Why unbound?"},{"location":"u_e-xmpp-enable/","text":"XMPP is provided by ejabberd, which describes itself as robust, scalable and extensible XMPP Server. So first of all, thanks to ejabberd and its contributers! Enable XMPP in mailcow \u00b6 To enable XMPP for a domain, you need to edit the given domain in mailcow UI: The chosen prefix will be used to derive your XMPP login. A prefix xmpp_prefix for the mailbox user cowboy@develcow.de would equal to the JID cowboy@xmpp_prefix.develcow.de . Info The login passwords for mail and XMPP are the same. XMPP users are authenticated against mailcow. Before enabling XMPP for a domain, you should create two CNAME records in DNS: # CNAMES # Name Type Value xmpp_prefix IN CNAME mail.example.org. (your ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME}) *.xmpp_prefix IN CNAME mail.example.org. (your ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME}) These two CNAMEs are essential for acquiring a certificate. Please do not add \"xmpp_prefix.domain.tld\" as name to ADDITIONAL_SAN . Make sure your CNAMEs are correct. Enable XMPP for your domain now. If you enabled XMPP first and then added your DNS records there is no need to worry. You will just need to wait for ejabberd to automatically acquire the certificates or simply restart ejabberd-mailcow to trigger the process immediately: docker-compose restart ejabberd-mailcow . Once ejabberd is enabled, you may want to re-run the DNS check in the mailcow UI where you will find two more SRV records: # SRV records # Name Type Value _xmpp-client._tcp.xmpp_prefix IN SRV 10 1 5222 mail.example.org.
