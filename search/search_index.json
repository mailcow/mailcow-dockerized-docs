Install Docker Compose v2 \u00b6 Danger As of June 2022, Docker Compose v1 has been replaced in mailcow by Docker Compose v2. Docker Compose v1 will lose official support from Docker in October 2022. mailcow supports Docker Compose v1 until December 2022, after which installation is imperative should you wish to continue running mailcow. Compatibility The web interface will only be accessible via v4 by default in the period from June - December 2022. The reason for this is the dual compatibility between Compose v1 and v2. Should you wish to access the web interface, as before by default via v6, please take a look at this chapter . The 2022-12 update will restore the native IPv6 reachability from the UI. If you are freshly installing mailcow and have installed Docker in the above way, Docker Compose v2 will already be installed with it. So you don't need to do anything else. You can check this with docker compose version , if the return looks something like Docker Compose version v2.5.0 , then the new Docker Compose is already installed on your system. If it is not installed or you want to upgrade from Docker Compose v1 to v2 just follow the instructions: Uninstall Docker Compose v1 \u00b6 If you are already running the mailcow stack with docker-compose v1, make sure you have shut down the mailcow stack and installed the latest update before upgrading to Compose v2 . To uninstall Docker Compose v1 enter the following command: rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Install Docker Compose v2 \u00b6 Docker Compose v2 comes with the repository (assuming you followed the instructions at point installing Docker ). Then the installation is quite simple: apt install docker-compose-plugin -y Now type docker compose version again and check the return. Is it similar to: Docker Compose version v2.5.0 ? Then everything has been installed correctly! Warning If you are using an operating system other than Debian/Ubuntu, please take a look at the official installation manual of Docker itself to learn how to install Docker Compose v2 on other Linux systems. Install mailcow \u00b6 1. Clone the master branch of the repository, make sure your umask equals 0022. Please clone the repository as root user and also control the stack as root. We will modify attributes - if necessary - while bootstrapping the containers automatically and make sure everything is secured. The update.sh script must therefore also be run as root. It might be necessary to change ownership and other attributes of files you will otherwise not have access to. We drop permissions for every exposed application and will not run an exposed service as root! Controlling the Docker daemon as non-root user does not give you additional security. The unprivileged user will spawn the containers as root likewise. The behaviour of the stack is identical. $ su # umask 0022 # <- Verify it is 0022 # cd /opt # git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized # cd mailcow-dockerized 2. Generate a configuration file. Use a FQDN ( host.domain.tld ) as hostname when asked. ./generate_config.sh 3. Change configuration if you want or need to. nano mailcow.conf If you plan to use a reverse proxy, you can, for example, bind HTTPS to 127.0.0.1 on port 8443 and HTTP to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080. You may need to stop an existing pre-installed MTA which blocks port 25/tcp. See this chapter to learn how to reconfigure Postfix to run besides mailcow after a successful installation. Some updates modify mailcow.conf and add new parameters. It is hard to keep track of them in the documentation. Please check their description and, if unsure, ask at the known channels for advise. 3.1. Users with a MTU not equal to 1500 (e.g. OpenStack): Whenever you run into trouble and strange phenomena, please check your MTU.

Users without an IPv6 enabled network on their host system: Enable IPv6. Finally. If you do not have an IPv6 enabled network on your host and you don't care for a better internet (thehe), it is recommended to disable IPv6 for the mailcow network to prevent unforeseen issues. 4.

Learn Spam & Ham \u00b6 Rspamd learns mail as spam or ham when you move a message in or out of the junk folder to any mailbox besides trash. This is achieved by using the Sieve plugin \"sieve_imapsieve\" and parser scripts. Rspamd also auto-learns mail when a high or low score is detected (see https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/statistic.html#autolearning ). We configured the plugin to keep a sane ratio between spam and ham learns. The bayes statistics are written to Redis as keys BAYES_HAM and BAYES_SPAM . Besides bayes, a local fuzzy storage is used to learn recurring patterns in text or images that indicate ham or spam. You can also use Rspamd's web UI to learn ham and / or spam or to adjust certain settings of Rspamd. Learn Spam or Ham from existing directory \u00b6 You can use a one-liner to learn mail in plain-text (uncompressed) format: # Ham for file in /my/folder/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_ham < $file ; done # Spam for file in /my/folder/.Junk/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_spam < $file ; done Consider attaching a local folder as new volume to rspamd-mailcow in docker-compose.yml and learn given files inside the container. This can be used as workaround to parse compressed data with zcat. Example: for file in /data/old_mail/.Junk/cur/* ; do rspamc learn_spam < zcat $file ; done Reset learned data (Bayes, Neural) \u00b6 You need to delete keys in Redis to reset learned data, so create a copy of your Redis database now: Backup database # It is better to stop Redis before you copy the file. cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/mailcowdockerized_redis-vol-1/_data/dump.rdb /root/ Reset Bayes data docker compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern BAYES_* | xargs redis-cli del' docker compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern RS* | xargs redis-cli del' Reset Neural data docker compose exec redis-mailcow sh -c 'redis-cli --scan --pattern rn_* | xargs redis-cli del' Reset Fuzzy data # We need to enter the redis-cli first: docker compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli # In redis-cli: 127 .0.0.1:6379> EVAL \"for i, name in ipairs(redis.call('KEYS', ARGV[1])) do redis.call('DEL', name); end\" 0 fuzzy* Info If redis-cli complains about...

CLI tools \u00b6 docker compose exec rspamd-mailcow rspamc --help docker compose exec rspamd-mailcow rspamadm --help Disable Greylisting \u00b6 Only messages with a higher score will be considered to be greylisted (soft rejected). It is bad practice to disable greylisting. You can disable greylisting server-wide by editing: {mailcow-dir}/data/conf/rspamd/local.d/greylist.conf Add the line: enabled = false ; Save the file and restart \"rspamd-mailcow\": docker compose restart rspamd-mailcow Spam filter thresholds (global) \u00b6 Each user is able to change their spam rating individually .

To reset custom defined thresholds, run: source mailcow.conf docker compose exec mysql-mailcow mysql -umailcow -p$DBPASS mailcow -e \"delete from filterconf where option = 'highspamlevel' or option = 'lowspamlevel';\" # or: # docker compose exec mysql-mailcow mysql -umailcow -p$DBPASS mailcow -e \"delete from filterconf where option = 'highspamlevel' or option = 'lowspamlevel' and object = 'only-this-mailbox@example.org';\" Custom reject messages \u00b6 The default spam reject message can be changed by adding a new file data/conf/rspamd/override.d/worker-proxy.custom.inc with the following content: reject_message = \"My custom reject message\"; Save the file and restart Rspamd: docker compose restart rspamd-mailcow . While the above works for rejected mails with a high spam score, prefilter reject actions will ignore this setting. For these maps, the multimap module in Rspamd needs to be adjusted: Find prefilet reject symbol for which you want change message, to do it run: grep -R \"SYMBOL_YOU_WANT_TO_ADJUST\" /opt/mailcow-dockerized/data/conf/rspamd/ Add your custom message as new line: GLOBAL_RCPT_BL { type = \"rcpt\"; map = \"${LOCAL_CONFDIR}/custom/global_rcpt_blacklist.map\"; regexp = true; prefilter = true; action = \"reject\"; message = \"Sending mail to this recipient is prohibited by postmaster@your.domain\"; } Save the file and restart Rspamd: docker compose restart rspamd-mailcow .

Both WebAuthn and Yubi OTP work well with the fantastic Yubikey . While Yubi OTP needs an active internet connection and an API ID + key, WebAuthn will work with any Fido Security Key out of the box, but can only be used when mailcow is accessed over HTTPS. WebAuthn and Yubi OTP support multiple keys per user. As the third TFA method mailcow uses TOTP: time-based one-time passwords. Those passwords can be generated with apps like \"Google Authenticator\" after initially scanning a QR code or entering the given secret manually. As administrator you are able to temporary disable a domain administrators TFA login until they successfully logged in. The key used to login will be displayed in green, while other keys remain grey. Information on how to remove 2FA can be found here . Yubi OTP \u00b6 The Yubi API ID and Key will be checked against the Yubico Cloud API. When setting up TFA you will be asked for your personal API account for this key. The API ID, API key and the first 12 characters (your YubiKeys ID in modhex) are stored in the MySQL table as secret. Example setup \u00b6 First of all, the YubiKey must be configured for use as an OTP Generator. To do this, download the YubiKey Manager from the Yubico website: here In the following you configure the YubiKey for OTP. Via the menu item Applications -> OTP and a click on the Configure button. In the following menu select Credential Type -> Yubico OTP and click on Next . Set a checkmark in the Use serial checkbox, generate a Private ID and a Secret key via the buttons. So that the YubiKey can be validated later, the checkmark in the Upload checkbox must also be set and then click on Finish . Now a new browser window will open in which you have to enter an OTP of your YubiKey at the bottom of the form (click on the field and then tap on your YubiKey). Confirm the captcha and upload the information to the Yubico server by clicking 'Upload'. The processing of the data will take a moment. After the generation was successful, you will be shown a Client ID and a Secret key , make a note of this information in a safe place. Now you can select Yubico OTP authentication from the dropdown menu in the mailcow UI on the start page under Access -> Two-factor authentication . In the dialog that opened now you can enter a name for this YubiKey and insert the Client ID you noted before as well as the Secret key into the fields provided. Finally, enter your current account password and, after selecting the Touch Yubikey field, touch your YubiKey button. Congratulations! You can now log in to the mailcow UI using your YubiKey! WebAuthn (U2F, replacement) \u00b6 Warning Since February 2022 Google Chrome has discarded support for U2F and standardized the use of WebAuthn. The WebAuthn (U2F removal) is part of mailcow since 21th January 2022, so if you want to use the Key past February 2022 please consider a update with the update.sh To use WebAuthn, the browser must support this standard. The following desktop browsers support this authentication type: Edge (>=18) Firefox (>=60) Chrome (>=67) Safari (>=13) Opera (>=54) The following mobile browsers support this authentication type: Safari on iOS (>=14.5) Android Browser (>=97) Opera Mobile (>=64) Chrome for Android (>=97) Sources: caniuse.com , blog.mozilla.org WebAuthn works without an internet connection. What will happen to my registered Fido Security Key after the Update from U2F to WebAuthn? \u00b6 Warning With this new U2F replacement (WebAuthn) you have to re-register your Fido Security Key, thankfully WebAuthn is backwards compatible and supports the U2F protocol. Ideally, the next time you log in (with the key), you should get a text box saying that your Fido Security Key has been removed due to the update to WebAuthn and deleted as a 2-factor authenticator. But don't worry! You can simply re-register your existing key and use it as usual, you probably won't even notice a difference, except that your browser won't show the U2F deactivation message anymore. Disable unofficial supported Fido Security Keys \u00b6 With WebAuthn there is the possibility to use only official Fido Security Keys (from the big brands like: Yubico, Apple, Nitro, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, etc.). This is primarily for security purposes, as it allows administrators to ensure that only official hardware can be used in their environment. To enable this feature, change the value WEBAUTHN_ONLY_TRUSTED_VENDORS in mailcow.conf from n to y and restart the affected containers with docker compose up -d . The mailcow will now use the Vendor Certificates located in your mailcow directory under data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates . Example: \u00b6 If you want to limit the official Vendor devices to Apple only you only need the Apple Vendor Certificate inside the data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates . After you deleted all other certs you now only can activate WebAuthn 2FA with Apple devices. That\u00b4s for every vendor the same, so choose what you like (if you want to). Use own certificates for WebAuthn \u00b6 If you have a valid certificate from the vendor of your key you can also add it to your mailcow! Just copy the certificate into the data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates folder and restart your mailcow. Now you should be able to register this device as well, even though the verification for the vendor certificates is enabled, since you just added the certificate manually. Is it dangerous to keep the Vendor Check disabled? \u00b6 No, it isn\u00b4t! These vendor certificates are only used to verify original hardware, not to secure the registration process. As you can read in these articles, the deactivation is not software security related: - https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Attestation_and_Metadata/ - https://medium.com/webauthnworks/webauthn-fido2-demystifying-attestation-and-mds-efc3b3cb3651 - https://medium.com/webauthnworks/sorting-fido-ctap-webauthn-terminology-7d32067c0b01 In the end, however, it is of course your decision to leave this check disabled or enabled.

Instead of editing docker-compose.yml directly, it is preferable to create an override file for it and implement your changes to the service there. Unfortunately, this right now only seems to work for services, not for network settings. To disable IPv6 on the mailcow network, open docker-compose.yml with your favourite text editor and search for the network section (it's near the bottom of the file). 1. Modify docker-compose.yml Change enable_ipv6: true to enable_ipv6: false : networks: mailcow-network: [...] enable_ipv6: true # <<< set to false [...] 2. Disable ipv6nat-mailcow To disable the ipv6nat-mailcow container as well, go to your mailcow directory and create a new file called \"docker-compose.override.yml\": NOTE: If you already have an override file, of course don't recreate it, but merge the lines below into your existing one accordingly! # cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized # touch docker-compose.override.yml Open the file in your favourite text editor and fill in the following: version: '2.1' services: ipv6nat-mailcow: image: bash:latest restart: \"no\" entrypoint: [\"echo\", \"ipv6nat disabled in compose.override.yml\"] For these changes to be effective, you need to fully stop and then restart the stack, so containers and networks are recreated: docker compose down docker compose up -d 3. Disable IPv6 in unbound-mailcow Edit data/conf/unbound/unbound.conf and set do-ip6 to \"no\": server: [...] do-ip6: no [...] Restart Unbound: docker compose restart unbound-mailcow 4.

You can either reload your webserver daily or write a script to watch the file for changes. On many servers logrotate will reload the webserver daily anyway. If you want to use a local certbot installation, you will need to change the SSL certificate parameters accordingly. Make sure you run a post-hook script when you decide to use external ACME clients.

See more in the Reverse Proxy documentation. By default, which means 0 domains are added to mailcow, it will try to obtain a certificate for ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} . For each domain you add, it will try to resolve autodiscover.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN and autoconfig.ADDED_MAIL_DOMAIN to its IPv6 address or - if IPv6 is not configured in your domain - IPv4 address. If it succeeds, a name will be added as SAN to the certificate request. Only names that can be validated, will be added as SAN. For every domain you remove, the certificate will be moved and a new certificate will be requested. It is not possible to keep domains in a certificate, when we are not able validate the challenge for those.

ADDITIONAL_SERVER_NAMES=webmail.domain.tld,other.example.tld Run docker compose up -d to apply. Force renewal \u00b6 To force a renewal, you need to create a file named force_renew and restart the acme-mailcow container: cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized touch data/assets/ssl/force_renew docker compose restart acme-mailcow # Now check the logs for a renewal docker compose logs --tail=200 -f acme-mailcow The file will be deleted automatically. Validation errors and how to skip validation \u00b6 You can skip the IP verification by setting SKIP_IP_CHECK=y in mailcow.conf (no quotes). Be warned that a misconfiguration will get you ratelimited by Let's Encrypt! This is primarily useful for multi-IP setups where the IP check would return the incorrect source IP address. Due to using dynamic IPs for acme-mailcow, source NAT is not consistent over restarts. If you encounter problems with \"HTTP validation\", but your IP address confirmation succeeds, you are most likely using firewalld, ufw or any other firewall, that disallows connections from br-mailcow to your external interface. Both firewalld and ufw disallow this by default. It is often not enough to just stop these firewall services. You'd need to stop mailcow ( docker compose down ), stop the firewall service, flush the chains and restart Docker. You can also skip this validation method by setting SKIP_HTTP_VERIFICATION=y in \"mailcow.conf\". Be warned that this is discouraged. In most cases, the HTTP verification is skipped to workaround unknown NAT reflection issues, which are not resolved by ignoring this specific network misconfiguration. If you encounter problems generating TLSA records in the DNS overview within mailcow, you are most likely having issues with NAT reflection you should fix. If you changed a SKIP_* parameter, run docker compose up -d to apply your changes. Disable Let's Encrypt \u00b6 Disable Let's Encrypt completely \u00b6 Set SKIP_LETS_ENCRYPT=y in \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker compose up -d . Skip all names but ${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} \u00b6 Add ONLY_MAILCOW_HOSTNAME=y to \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker compose up -d . The Let's Encrypt subjectAltName limit of 100 domains \u00b6 Let's Encrypt currently has a limit of 100 Domain Names per Certificate . By default, \"acme-mailcow\" will create a single SAN certificate for all validated domains (see the first section and Additional domain names ). This provides best compatibility but means the Let's Encrypt limit exceeds if you add too many domains to a single mailcow installation. To solve this, you can configure ENABLE_SSL_SNI to generate: A main server certificate with MAILCOW_HOSTNAME and all fully qualified domain names in the ADDITIONAL_SAN config One additional certificate for each domain found in the database with autodiscover. , autoconfig. and any other ADDITIONAL_SAN configured in this format (subdomain.*). Limitations: A certificate name ADDITIONAL_SAN=test.example.com will be added as SAN to the main certificate. A separate certificate/key pair will not be generated for this format. Postfix, Dovecot and Nginx will then serve these certificates with SNI. Set ENABLE_SSL_SNI=y in \"mailcow.conf\" and recreate \"acme-mailcow\" by running docker compose up -d . Warning Not all clients support SNI, see Dovecot documentation or Wikipedia . You should make sure these clients use the MAILCOW_HOSTNAME for secure connections if you enable this feature. Here is an example: MAILCOW_HOSTNAME=server.email.tld ADDITIONAL_SAN=webmail.email.tld,mail.* Mailcow email domains: \"domain1.tld\" and \"domain2.tld\" The following certificates will be generated: server.email.tld, webmail.email.tld -> this is the default certificate, all clients can connect with these domains mail.domain1.tld, autoconfig.domain1.tld, autodiscover.domain1.tld -> individual certificate for domain1.tld, cannot be used by clients without SNI support mail.domain2.tld, autoconfig.domain2.tld, autodiscover.domain2.tld -> individual certificate for domain2.tld, cannot be used by clients without SNI support How to use your own certificate \u00b6 Make sure you disable mailcows internal LE client (see above). To use your own certificates, just save the combined certificate (containing the certificate and intermediate CA/CA if any) to data/assets/ssl/cert.pem and the corresponding key to data/assets/ssl/key.pem . IMPORTANT: Do not use symbolic links! Make sure you copy the certificates and do not link them to data/assets/ssl . Restart affected services afterwards: docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=postfix-mailcow) docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=nginx-mailcow) docker restart $(docker ps -qaf name=dovecot-mailcow) See Post-hook script for non-mailcow ACME clients for a full example script. Test against staging ACME directory \u00b6 Edit mailcow.conf and add LE_STAGING=y . Run docker compose up -d to activate your changes. Custom directory URL \u00b6 Edit mailcow.conf and add the corresponding directory URL to the new variable DIRECTORY_URL : DIRECTORY_URL=https://acme-custom-v9000.api.letsencrypt.org/directory You cannot use LE_STAGING with DIRECTORY_URL . If both are set, only LE_STAGING is used. Run docker compose up -d to activate your changes. Check your configuration \u00b6 Run docker compose logs acme-mailcow to find out why a validation fails. To check if nginx serves the correct certificate, simply use a browser of your choice and check the displayed certificate.

Both firewalld and ufw disallow this by default. It is often not enough to just stop these firewall services. You'd need to stop mailcow ( docker compose down ), stop the firewall service, flush the chains and restart Docker. You can also skip this validation method by setting SKIP_HTTP_VERIFICATION=y in \"mailcow.conf\". Be warned that this is discouraged.

Info mailcow: dockerized requires some ports to be open for incoming connections, so make sure that your firewall is not blocking these. Make sure that no other application is interfering with mailcow's configuration, such as another mail service A correct DNS setup is crucial to every good mailserver setup, so please make sure you got at least the basics covered before you begin! Make sure that your system has a correct date and time setup . This is crucial for various components like two factor TOTP authentication. Minimum System Resources \u00b6 Not supported OpenVZ, Virtuozzo and LXC Please make sure that your system has at least the following resources: Resource mailcow: dockerized CPU 1 GHz RAM Minimum 6 GiB + 1 GiB swap (default config) Disk 20 GiB (without emails) System Type x86_64 ClamAV and Solr can be greedy with RAM. You may disable them in mailcow.conf by settings SKIP_CLAMD=y and SKIP_SOLR=y . Info We are aware that a pure MTA can run on 128 MiB RAM. mailcow is a full-grown and ready-to-use groupware with many extras making life easier. mailcow comes with a webserver, webmailer, ActiveSync (MS), antivirus, antispam, indexing (Solr), document scanner (Oletools), SQL (MariaDB), Cache (Redis), MDA, MTA, various web services etc. A single SOGo worker can acquire ~350 MiB RAM before it gets purged. The more ActiveSync connections you plan to use, the more RAM you will need. A default configuration spawns 20 workers. RAM usage examples \u00b6 A company with 15 phones (EAS enabled) and about 50 concurrent IMAP connections should plan 16 GiB RAM. 6 GiB RAM + 1 GiB swap are fine for most private installations while 8 GiB RAM are recommended for ~5 to 10 users. We can help to correctly plan your setup as part of our support. Supported OS \u00b6 We recommend using any distribution listed as supported by Docker CE (check https://docs.docker.com/install/ ). See the following table for the official supported and tested destributions: OS Status Centos 7 \u2705 Debian 10, 11 \u2705 Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04 \u2705 Other Distributions may work as well but weren\u00b4t tested by us!

You should disable it (if possible) and move your ruleset to the DOCKER-USER chain, which is not cleared by a Docker service restart, instead. See this (blog.donnex.net) or this (unrouted.io) guide for information about how to use iptables-persistent with the DOCKER-USER chain. As mailcow runs dockerized, INPUT rules have no effect on restricting access to mailcow. Use the FORWARD chain instead. If this command returns any results please remove or stop the application running on that port. You may also adjust mailcows ports via the mailcow.conf configuration file. Default Ports \u00b6 If you have a firewall in front of mailcow, please make sure that these ports are open for incoming connections: Service Protocol Port Container Variable Postfix SMTP TCP 25 postfix-mailcow ${SMTP_PORT} Postfix SMTPS TCP 465 postfix-mailcow ${SMTPS_PORT} Postfix Submission TCP 587 postfix-mailcow ${SUBMISSION_PORT} Dovecot IMAP TCP 143 dovecot-mailcow ${IMAP_PORT} Dovecot IMAPS TCP 993 dovecot-mailcow ${IMAPS_PORT} Dovecot POP3 TCP 110 dovecot-mailcow ${POP_PORT} Dovecot POP3S TCP 995 dovecot-mailcow ${POPS_PORT} Dovecot ManageSieve TCP 4190 dovecot-mailcow ${SIEVE_PORT} HTTP(S) TCP 80/443 nginx-mailcow ${HTTP_PORT} / ${HTTPS_PORT} To bind a service to an IP address, you can prepend the IP like this: SMTP_PORT=1.2.3.4:25 Important : You cannot use IP:PORT bindings in HTTP_PORT and HTTPS_PORT.

Due to it's deduplication capabilities you can store a great number of backups without wasting large amounts of disk space. This allows you to run backups in very short intervals to ensure minimal data loss when the need arises to recover data from a backup. This document guides you through the process to enable continuous backups for mailcow with borgmatic. The borgmatic functionality is provided by the borgmatic Docker image by b3vis . Check out the README in that repository to find out about the other options (such as push notifications) that are available. This guide only covers the basics. Setting up borgmatic \u00b6 Create or amend docker-compose.override.yml \u00b6 In the mailcow-dockerized root folder create or edit docker-compose.override.yml and insert the following configuration: version : '2.1' services : borgmatic-mailcow : image : b3vis/borgmatic hostname : mailcow restart : always dns : ${IPV4_NETWORK:-172.22.1}.254 volumes : - vmail-vol-1:/mnt/source/vmail:ro - crypt-vol-1:/mnt/source/crypt:ro - redis-vol-1:/mnt/source/redis:ro,z - rspamd-vol-1:/mnt/source/rspamd:ro,z - postfix-vol-1:/mnt/source/postfix:ro,z - mysql-socket-vol-1:/var/run/mysqld/:z - borg-config-vol-1:/root/.config/borg:Z - borg-cache-vol-1:/root/.cache/borg:Z - ./data/conf/borgmatic/etc:/etc/borgmatic.d:Z - ./data/conf/borgmatic/ssh:/root/.ssh:Z environment : - TZ=${TZ} - BORG_PASSPHRASE=YouBetterPutSomethingRealGoodHere networks : mailcow-network : aliases : - borgmatic volumes : borg-cache-vol-1 : borg-config-vol-1 : Ensure that you change the BORG_PASSPHRASE to a secure passphrase of your choosing. For security reasons we mount the maildir as read-only. If you later want to restore data you will need to remove the ro flag prior to restoring the data. This is described in the section on restoring backups. Create data/conf/borgmatic/etc/config.yaml \u00b6 Next, we need to create the borgmatic configuration. source mailcow.conf cat <<EOF > data/conf/borgmatic/etc/config.yaml location: source_directories: - /mnt/source repositories: - user@rsync.net:mailcow exclude_patterns: - '/mnt/source/postfix/public/' - '/mnt/source/postfix/private/' - '/mnt/source/rspamd/rspamd.sock' retention: keep_hourly: 24 keep_daily: 7 keep_weekly: 4 keep_monthly: 6 prefix: \"\" hooks: mysql_databases: - name: ${DBNAME} username: ${DBUSER} password: ${DBPASS} options: --default-character-set=utf8mb4 EOF Creating the file in this way ensures the correct MySQL credentials are pulled in from mailcow.conf . This file is a minimal example for using borgmatic with an account user on the cloud storage provider rsync.net for a repository called mailcow (see repositories setting). It will backup both the maildir and MySQL database, which is all you should need to restore your mailcow setup after an incident. The retention settings will keep one archive for each hour of the past 24 hours, one per day of the week, one per week of the month and one per month of the past half year. Check the borgmatic documentation on how to use other types of repositories or configuration options. If you choose to use a local filesystem as a backup destination make sure to mount it into the container. The container defines a volume called /mnt/borg-repository for this purpose. Note If you do not use rsync.net you can most likely drop the remote_path element from your config. Create a crontab \u00b6 Create a new text file in data/conf/borgmatic/etc/crontab.txt with the following content: 14 * * * * PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/bin/borgmatic --stats -v 0 2>&1 This file expects crontab syntax. The example shown here will trigger the backup to run every hour at 14 minutes past the hour and log some nice stats at the end. Place SSH keys in folder \u00b6 Place the SSH keys you intend to use for remote repository connections in data/conf/borgmatic/ssh . OpenSSH expects the usual id_rsa , id_ed25519 or similar to be in this directory. Ensure the file is chmod 600 and not world readable or OpenSSH will refuse to use the SSH key. Bring up the container \u00b6 For the next step we need the container to be up and running in a configured state. To do that run: docker compose up -d Initialize the repository \u00b6 By now your borgmatic container is up and running, but the backups will currently fail due to the repository not being initialized. To initialize the repository run: docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic init --encryption repokey-blake2 You will be asked you to authenticate the SSH host key of your remote repository server. See if it matches and confirm the prompt by entering yes . The repository will be initialized with the passphrase you set in the BORG_PASSPHRASE environment variable earlier. When using any of the repokey encryption methods the encryption key will be stored in the repository itself and not on the client, so there is no further action required in this regard. If you decide to use a keyfile instead of a repokey make sure you export the key and back it up separately. Check the Exporting Keys section for how to retrieve the key. Restart container \u00b6 Now that we finished configuring and initializing the repository restart the container to ensure it is in a defined state: docker compose restart borgmatic-mailcow Restoring from a backup \u00b6 Restoring a backup assumes you are starting off with a fresh installation of mailcow, and you currently do not have any custom data in your maildir or your mailcow database. Restore maildir \u00b6 Warning Doing this will overwrite files in your maildir! Do not run this unless you actually intend to recover mail files from a backup. If you use SELinux in Enforcing mode If you are using mailcow on a host with SELinux in Enforcing mode you will have to temporarily disable it during extraction of the archive as the mailcow setup labels the vmail volume as private, belonging to the dovecot container exclusively. SELinux will (rightfully) prevent any other container, such as the borgmatic container, from writing to this volume. Before running a restore you must make the vmail volume writeable in docker-compose.override.yml by removing the ro flag from the volume. Then you can use the following command to restore the maildir from a backup: docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic extract --path mnt/source --archive latest Alternatively you can specify any archive name from the list of archives (see Listing all available archives ) Restore MySQL \u00b6 Warning Running this command will delete and recreate the mailcow database! Do not run this unless you actually intend to recover the mailcow database from a backup. To restore the MySQL database from the latest archive use this command: docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic restore --archive latest Alternatively you can specify any archive name from the list of archives (see Listing all available archives ) After restoring \u00b6 After restoring you need to restart mailcow. If you disabled SELinux enforcing mode now would be a good time to re-enable it. To restart mailcow use the follwing command: docker compose down && docker compose up -d If you use SELinux this will also trigger the re-labeling of all files in your vmail volume. Be patient, as this may take a while if you have lots of files. Useful commands \u00b6 Manual archiving run (with debugging output) \u00b6 docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic -v 2 Listing all available archives \u00b6 docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borgmatic list Break lock \u00b6 When borg is interrupted during an archiving run it will leave behind a stale lock that needs to be cleared before any new operations can be performed: docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borg break-lock user@rsync.net:mailcow Where user@rsync.net:mailcow is the URI to your repository. Now would be a good time to do a manual archiving run to ensure it can be successfully performed. Exporting keys \u00b6 When using any of the keyfile methods for encryption you MUST take care of backing up the key files yourself. The key files are generated when you initialize the repository. The repokey methods store the key file within the repository, so a manual backup isn't as essential. Note that in either case you also must have the passphrase to decrypt any archives. To fetch the keyfile run: docker compose exec borgmatic-mailcow borg key export --paper user@rsync.net:mailcow Where user@rsync.net:mailcow is the URI to your repository.","title":"Borgmatic Backup"},{"location":"third_party/third_party-borgmatic/#borgmatic-backup","text":"","title":"Borgmatic Backup"},{"location":"third_party/third_party-borgmatic/#introduction","text":"Borgmatic is a great way to run backups on your Mailcow setup as it securely encrypts your data and is extremely easy to set up.

With this setup you can add mailboxes on your mailcow and still use Exchange Online Protection . All mailboxes setup in Exchange will receive their mails as usual , while with the hybrid approach additional Mailboxes can be setup in mailcow without any further configuration. This setup becomes very handy if you have enabled the Office 365 security defaults and third party applications can no longer login into your mailboxes by any of the supported methods . Requirements \u00b6 The mx Record of your domain needs to point at the Exchange mail service. Log into your Admin center and look out for the dns settings of your domain to find your personalized gateway domain. It should look like this contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com . Contact your domain registrant to get further information on how to change mx record. The domain you want to have additional mailboxes for must be setup as internal relay domain in Exchange. Log in to your Exchange Admin Center Select the mail flow pane and click on accepted domains Select the domain and switch it from authorative to internal relay Set up the mailcow \u00b6 Your mailcow needs to relay all mails to your personalized Exchange Host. It is the same host address we already looked up for the mx Record. Add the domain to your mailcow Add your personalized Exchange Host address as relayhost Add your personalized Exchange Host address as forwarding host to unconditionally accepted all relayed mails from Exchange. (Admin > Configuration & Details > Configuration Dropdown > Forwarding Hosts) Go to the domain settings and select the newly added host on the Sender-dependent transports dropdown. Enable relaying by ticking the Relay this domain , Relay all recipients and the Relay non-existing mailboxes only. checkboxes Info From now on your mailcow will accept all mails relayed from Exchange. The inbound filtering and so the neural learning of your cow will no longer work . Because all mails are routed through Exchange the filtering process is handled there . Set up Connectors in Exchange \u00b6 All mail traffic now goes through Exchange. At this point the Exchange Online Protection already filters all incoming and outgoing mails. Now we need to set up two connectors to relay incoming mails from our Exchange Service to the mailcow and another one to allow mails relayed from the mailcow to our exchange service. You can follow the official guide from Microsoft . Warning For the connector that handles mails from your mailcow to Exchange Microsoft offers two ways of authenticating it. The recommended way is to use a tls certificate configured with a subject name that matches an accepted domain in Exchange.

This guide comes without any warranty. Make backups before starting, 'coze: No backup no pity! Introduction \u00b6 This guide aims to install and configure mailcow-dockerized with docker-mailman and to provide some useful scripts. An essential condition is, to preserve mailcow and Mailman in their own installations for independent updates. There are some guides and projects on the internet, but they are not up to date and/or incomplete in documentation or configuration. This guide is based on the work of: mailcow-mailman3-dockerized by Shadowghost mailman-mailcow-integration After finishing this guide, mailcow-dockerized and docker-mailman will run and Apache as a reverse proxy will serve the web frontends. The operating system used is an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS . Installation \u00b6 This guide is based on different steps: DNS setup Install Apache as a reverse proxy Obtain SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt Install mailcow with Mailman integration Install Mailman \ud83c\udfc3 Run DNS setup \u00b6 Most of the configuration is covered by mailcow s DNS setup . After finishing this setup add another subdomain for Mailman , e.g. lists.example.org that points to the same server: # Name Type Value lists IN A 1.2.3.4 lists IN AAAA dead:beef Install Apache as a reverse proxy \u00b6 Install Apache , e.g. with this guide from Digital Ocean : How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 20.04 . Activate certain Apache modules (as root or sudo ): a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http headers ssl wsgi proxy_uwsgi http2 Maybe you have to install further packages to get these modules. This PPA by Ond\u0159ej Sur\u00fd may help you. vHost configuration \u00b6 Copy the mailcow.conf and the mailman.conf in the Apache conf folder sites-available (e.g. under /etc/apache2/sites-available ). Change in mailcow.conf : - MAILCOW_HOSTNAME to your MAILCOW_HOSTNAME Change in mailman.conf : - MAILMAN_DOMAIN to your Mailman domain (e.g. lists.example.org ) Don't activate the configuration, as the ssl certificates and directories are missing yet. Obtain SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt \u00b6 Check if your DNS config is available over the internet and points to the right IP addresses, e.g. with MXToolBox : https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3aMAILCOW_HOSTNAME https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=aaaa%3aMAILCOW_HOSTNAME https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3aMAILMAN_DOMAIN https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=aaaa%3aMAILMAN_DOMAIN Install certbot (as root or sudo ): apt install certbot Get the desired certificates (as root or sudo ): certbot certonly -d mailcow_HOSTNAME certbot certonly -d MAILMAN_DOMAIN Install mailcow with Mailman integration \u00b6 Install mailcow \u00b6 Follow the mailcow installation . Omit step 5 and do not pull and up with docker compose ! Configure mailcow \u00b6 This is also Step 4 in the official mailcow installation ( nano mailcow.conf ). So change to your needs and alter the following variables: HTTP_PORT=18080 # don't use 8080 as mailman needs it HTTP_BIND=127.0.0.1 # HTTPS_PORT=18443 # you may use 8443 HTTPS_BIND=127.0.0.1 # SKIP_LETS_ENCRYPT=y # reverse proxy will do the SSL termination SNAT_TO_SOURCE=1.2.3.4 # change this to your IPv4 SNAT6_TO_SOURCE=dead:beef # change this to your global IPv6 Add Mailman integration \u00b6 Create the file /opt/mailcow-dockerized/docker-compose.override.yml (e.g. with nano ) and add the following lines: version: '2.1' services: postfix-mailcow: volumes: - /opt/mailman:/opt/mailman networks: - docker-mailman_mailman networks: docker-mailman_mailman: external: true The additional volume is used by Mailman to generate additional config files for mailcow postfix . The external network is build and used by Mailman . mailcow needs it to deliver incoming list mails to Mailman . Create the file /opt/mailcow-dockerized/data/conf/postfix/extra.cf (e.g. with nano ) and add the following lines: # mailman recipient_delimiter = + unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 550 owner_request_special = no local_recipient_maps = regexp:/opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_lmtp, proxy:unix:passwd.byname, $alias_maps virtual_mailbox_maps = proxy:mysql:/opt/postfix/conf/sql/mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf, regexp:/opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_lmtp transport_maps = pcre:/opt/postfix/conf/custom_transport.pcre, pcre:/opt/postfix/conf/local_transport, proxy:mysql:/opt/postfix/conf/sql/mysql_relay_ne.cf, proxy:mysql:/opt/postfix/conf/sql/mysql_transport_maps.cf, regexp:/opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_lmtp relay_domains = proxy:mysql:/opt/postfix/conf/sql/mysql_virtual_relay_domain_maps.cf, regexp:/opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_domains relay_recipient_maps = proxy:mysql:/opt/postfix/conf/sql/mysql_relay_recipient_maps.cf, regexp:/opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_lmtp As we overwrite mailcow postfix configuration here, this step may break your normal mail transports. Check the original configuration files if anything changed. SSL certificates \u00b6 As we proxying mailcow , we need to copy the SSL certificates into the mailcow file structure. This task will do the script renew-ssl.sh for us: Copy the file to /opt/mailcow-dockerized Change mailcow_HOSTNAME to your mailcow hostname Make it executable ( chmod a+x renew-ssl.sh ) Do not run it yet, as we first need Mailman You have to create a cronjob , so that new certificates will be copied. Execute as root or sudo : crontab -e To run the script every day at 5am, add: 0 5 * * * /opt/mailcow-dockerized/renew-ssl.sh Install Mailman \u00b6 Basicly follow the instructions at docker-mailman . As they are a lot, here is in a nuthshell what to do: As root or sudo : cd /opt mkdir -p mailman/core mkdir -p mailman/web git clone https://github.com/maxking/docker-mailman cd docker-mailman Configure Mailman \u00b6 Create a long key for Hyperkitty , e.g. with the linux command cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c30; echo .

You need the admin credentials to log into the web interface ( Pistorius ). For setting the password for the first time use the Forgot password function in the web interface. About other configuration options read Mailman-web and Mailman-core documentation. Configure Mailman core and Mailman web \u00b6 Create the file /opt/mailman/core/mailman-extra.cfg with the following content. mailman@example.org should be pointing to a valid mail box or redirection. [mailman] default_language: de site_owner: mailman@example.org Create the file /opt/mailman/web/settings_local.py with the following content. mailman@example.org should be pointing to a valid mail box or redirection. # locale LANGUAGE_CODE = 'de-de' # disable social authentication SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {} # change it DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'mailman@example.org' DEBUG = False You can change LANGUAGE_CODE and SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS to your needs. At the moment SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS has no effect, see issue #2 . \ud83c\udfc3 Run \u00b6 Run (as root or sudo ) a2ensite mailcow.conf a2ensite mailman.conf systemctl restart apache2 cd /opt/docker-mailman docker compose pull docker compose up -d cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized/ docker compose pull ./renew-ssl.sh Wait a few minutes! The containers have to create there databases and config files. This can last up to 1 minute and more. Remarks \u00b6 New lists aren't recognized by postfix instantly \u00b6 When you create a new list and try to immediately send an e-mail, postfix responses with User doesn't exist , because postfix won't deliver it to Mailman yet. The configuration at /opt/mailman/core/var/data/postfix_lmtp is not instantly updated. If you need the list instantly, restart postifx manually: cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized docker compose restart postfix-mailcow Update \u00b6 mailcow has it's own update script in /opt/mailcow-dockerized/update.sh , see the docs . For Mailman just fetch the newest version from the github repository . Backup \u00b6 mailcow has an own backup script. Read the docs for further informations. Mailman won't state backup instructions in the README.md. In the gitbucket of pgollor is a script that may be helpful. ToDo \u00b6 install script \u00b6 Write a script like in mailman-mailcow-integration/mailman-install.sh as many of the steps are automatable. Ask for all the configuration variables and create passwords and keys. Do a (semi-)automatic installation.

Disclaimer : This is not officially maintained nor supported by the mailcow project nor its contributors. No warranty or support is being provided, however you're free to open issues on GitHub for filing a bug or provide further ideas. GitHub repo can be found here . Info Support for domain wildcards were implemented in Piler 1.3.10 which was released on 03.01.2021. Prior versions basically do work, but after logging in you won't see emails sent from or to the domain alias. (e.g. when @example.com is an alias for admin@example.com ) The problem to solve \u00b6 mailpiler offers the authentication based on IMAP, for example: $config['ENABLE_IMAP_AUTH'] = 1; $config['IMAP_HOST'] = 'mail.example.com'; $config['IMAP_PORT'] = 993; $config['IMAP_SSL'] = true; So when you log in using patrik@example.com , you will only see delivered emails sent from or to this specific email address. When additional aliases are defined in mailcow, like team@example.com , you won't see emails sent to or from this email address even the fact you're a recipient of mails sent to this alias address. By hooking into the authentication process of mailpiler, we are able to get required data via the mailcow API during login. This fires API requests to the mailcow API (requiring read-only API access) to read out the aliases your email address participates and also the \"Name\" of the mailbox specified to display it on the top-right of mailpiler after login. Permitted email addresses can be seen in the mailpiler settings top-right after logging in. Info This is only pulled once during the authentication process. The authorized aliases and the realname are valid for the whole duration of the user session as mailpiler sets them in the session data. If user is removed from specific alias, this will only take effect after next login. The solution \u00b6 Note: File paths might vary depending on your setup.

Installation von Docker Compose v2 \u00b6 Achtung Seit Juni 2022 wurde Docker Compose v1 in der mailcow durch Docker Compose v2 abgel\u00f6st. Docker Compose v1 verliert den offiziellen Support seitens Docker im Oktober 2022. mailcow unterst\u00fctzt bis Dezember 2022 Docker Compose v1. Danach ist die Installation unumg\u00e4nglich , sollten Sie mailcow weiter betreiben wollen. Kompatibilit\u00e4t Das Webinterface wird im Zeitraum von Juni - Dezember 2022 standardm\u00e4\u00dfig nur \u00fcber v4 erreichbar sein. Der Grund daf\u00fcr ist die Dual-Kompatibilit\u00e4t zwischen Compose v1 und v2. Sollten Sie das Webinterface, wie bisher standardm\u00e4\u00dfig \u00fcber v6 erreichen wollen, werfen Sie bitte einen Blick auf dieses Kapitel . Mit dem 2022-12 Update wird die native IPv6 Erreichbarkeit der Weboberfl\u00e4che wiederhergestellt. Sollten Sie mailcow frisch installieren und Docker auf die oben stehende Weise installiert haben, wird Docker Compose v2 schon mit installiert. Sie m\u00fcssen also nichts weiter tun. Pr\u00fcfen l\u00e4sst sich dies mit docker compose version , wenn die R\u00fcckgabe in etwa so aussieht: Docker Compose version v2.5.0 , dann ist das neue Docker Compose bereits auf Ihrem System installiert. Falls es nicht installiert ist oder Sie von Docker-Compose v1 auf v2 Upgraden m\u00f6chten folgen Sie einfach der Anleitung: Docker Compose v1 deinstallieren \u00b6 Sollten Sie den mailcow Stack bereits mit docker-compose v1 betreiben, stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie den mailcow Stack vor dem Upgrade auf Compose v2 heruntergefahren und das aktuellste Update installiert haben Um Docker Compose v1 zu deinstallieren geben Sie folgenden Befehl ein: rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Docker Compose v2 installieren \u00b6 Docker Compose v2 kommt (vorausgesetzt Sie haben die Anleitung bei Punkt Installation von Docker befolgt) mit dem Repository mit. Dann ist die Installation ganz einfach: apt install docker-compose-plugin -y Nun noch einmal docker compose version eingeben und die R\u00fcckgabe \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Ist diese \u00e4hnlich zu: Docker Compose version v2.5.0 ? Dann ist alles korrekt installiert worden! Hinweis Sollten Sie ein anderes Betriebssystem als Debian/Ubuntu verwenden, werfen Sie bitte einen Blick in das offizielle Installationshandbuch von Docker selbst, um zu erfahren wie Sie Docker Compose v2 auf anderen Linux Systemen installieren k\u00f6nnen. Installation von mailcow \u00b6 1. Klonen Sie den Master-Zweig des Repositorys und stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre umask gleich 0022 ist. Bitte klonen Sie das Repository als root-Benutzer und kontrollieren Sie auch den Stack als root. Wir werden die Attribute - wenn n\u00f6tig - \u00e4ndern, w\u00e4hrend wir die Container automatisch bereitstellen und sicherstellen, dass alles gesichert ist. Das update.sh-Skript muss daher ebenfalls als root ausgef\u00fchrt werden. Es kann notwendig sein, den Besitzer und andere Attribute von Dateien zu \u00e4ndern, auf die Sie sonst keinen Zugriff haben. Wir geben die Berechtigungen f\u00fcr jede exponierte Anwendung auf und f\u00fchren einen exponierten Dienst nicht als root aus! Wenn Sie den Docker-Daemon als Nicht-Root-Benutzer steuern, erhalten Sie keine zus\u00e4tzliche Sicherheit. Der unprivilegierte Benutzer wird die Container ebenfalls als root spawnen. Das Verhalten des Stacks ist identisch. $ su # umask 0022 # <- \u00dcberpr\u00fcfen, dass es 0022 ist # cd /opt # git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized # cd mailcow-dockerized 2. Erzeugen Sie eine Konfigurationsdatei. Verwenden Sie einen FQDN ( host.domain.tld ) als Hostname, wenn Sie gefragt werden. ./generate_config.sh 3. \u00c4ndern Sie die Konfiguration, wenn Sie das wollen oder m\u00fcssen. nano mailcow.conf Wenn Sie planen, einen Reverse Proxy zu verwenden, k\u00f6nnen Sie zum Beispiel HTTPS an 127.0.0.1 auf Port 8443 und HTTP an 127.0.0.1 auf Port 8080 binden. M\u00f6glicherweise m\u00fcssen Sie einen vorinstallierten MTA stoppen, der Port 25/tcp blockiert. Siehe dieses Kapitel , um zu erfahren, wie man Postfix rekonfiguriert, um nach einer erfolgreichen Installation neben mailcow laufen zu lassen. Einige Updates modifizieren mailcow.conf und f\u00fcgen neue Parameter hinzu. Es ist schwer, in der Dokumentation den \u00dcberblick zu behalten. Bitte \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen Sie deren Beschreibung und fragen Sie, wenn Sie unsicher sind, in den bekannten Kan\u00e4len nach Rat. 3.1. Benutzer mit einer MTU ungleich 1500 (z.B. OpenStack): Wenn Sie auf Probleme und seltsame Ph\u00e4nomene sto\u00dfen, \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen Sie bitte Ihre MTU. Bearbeiten Sie docker-compose.yml und \u00e4ndern Sie die Netzwerkeinstellungen entsprechend Ihrer MTU. F\u00fcgen Sie den neuen Parameter driver_opts wie folgt hinzu: networks: mailcow-network: ... driver_opts: com.docker.network.driver.mtu: 1450 ... 3.2. Benutzer ohne ein IPv6-aktiviertes Netzwerk auf ihrem Hostsystem: Einschalten von IPv6. Endlich. Wenn Sie kein IPv6-f\u00e4higes Netzwerk auf Ihrem Host haben und Sie sich nicht um ein besseres Internet k\u00fcmmern (hehe), ist es empfehlenswert, IPv6 f\u00fcr das mailcow-Netzwerk zu deaktivieren , um unvorhergesehene Probleme zu vermeiden. 4. Laden Sie die Images herunter und f\u00fchren Sie die Compose-Datei aus. Der Parameter -d wird mailcow: dockerized starten: docker compose pull docker compose up -d Geschafft! Sie k\u00f6nnen nun auf https://${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME} mit den Standard-Zugangsdaten admin + Passwort moohoo zugreifen. Info Wenn Sie mailcow nicht hinter einem Reverse Proxy verwenden, sollten Sie alle HTTP-Anfragen auf HTTPS umleiten . Die Datenbank wird sofort initialisiert, nachdem eine Verbindung zu MySQL hergestellt werden kann. Ihre Daten bleiben in mehreren Docker-Volumes erhalten, die nicht gel\u00f6scht werden, wenn Sie Container neu erstellen oder l\u00f6schen. F\u00fchren Sie docker volume ls aus, um eine Liste aller Volumes zu sehen. Sie k\u00f6nnen docker compose down sicher ausf\u00fchren, ohne persistente Daten zu entfernen.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"de/i_u_m/i_u_m_install/#installation-von-docker","text":"Erfahren Sie, wie Sie Docker allgemein installieren.

Wenn Sie kein IPv6-f\u00e4higes Netzwerk auf Ihrem Host haben und Sie sich nicht um ein besseres Internet k\u00fcmmern (hehe), ist es empfehlenswert, IPv6 f\u00fcr das mailcow-Netzwerk zu deaktivieren , um unvorhergesehene Probleme zu vermeiden. 4.

Spam & Ham lernen \u00b6 Rspamd lernt, ob es sich um Spam oder Ham handelt, wenn Sie eine Nachricht in oder aus dem Junk-Ordner in ein anderes Postfach als den Papierkorb verschieben. Dies wird durch die Verwendung des Sieve-Plugins \"sieve_imapsieve\" und Parser-Skripte erreicht. Rspamd liest auch automatisch Mails, wenn eine hohe oder niedrige Punktzahl erkannt wird (siehe https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/statistic.html#autolearning ). Wir haben das Plugin so konfiguriert, dass es ein vern\u00fcnftiges Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Spam- und Ham-Learnings beibeh\u00e4lt. Die Bayes-Statistiken werden in Redis als Schl\u00fcssel BAYES_HAM und BAYES_SPAM gespeichert. Neben Bayes wird ein lokaler Fuzzy-Speicher verwendet, um wiederkehrende Muster in Texten oder Bildern zu lernen, die auf Ham oder Spam hinweisen. Sie k\u00f6nnen auch die Web-UI von Rspamd verwenden, um Ham und/oder Spam zu lernen oder bestimmte Einstellungen von Rspamd anzupassen. Spam oder Ham aus bestehendem Verzeichnis lernen \u00b6 Sie k\u00f6nnen einen Einzeiler verwenden, um Mails im Klartextformat (unkomprimiert) zu lernen: # Ham for file in /my/folder/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_ham < $file ; done # Spam for file in /my/folder/.Junk/cur/* ; do docker exec -i $( docker compose ps -q rspamd-mailcow ) rspamc learn_spam < $file ; done Erw\u00e4gen Sie, einen lokalen Ordner als neues Volume an rspamd-mailcow in docker-compose.yml anzuh\u00e4ngen und die gegebenen Dateien innerhalb des Containers zu lernen.

WebAuthn (U2F, Ersatz) \u00b6 Warning Seit Februar 2022 hat Google Chrome die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr U2F aufgegeben und die Verwendung von WebAuthn standardisiert. Die WebAuthn API (der Ersatz f\u00fcr U2F) ist seit dem 21. Januar 2022 Teil von mailcow, wenn Sie also den Key \u00fcber Februar 2022 hinaus nutzen wollen, sollten Sie ein Update mit der update.sh in Betracht ziehen. Um WebAuthn zu nutzen, muss der Browser diesen Standard unterst\u00fctzen: Edge (>=18) Firefox (>=60) Chrome (>=67) Safari (>=13) Opera (>=54) Die folgenden mobilen Browser unterst\u00fctzen diesen Authentifizierungstyp: Safari auf iOS (>=14.5) Android-Browser (>=97) Opera Mobil (>=64) Chrome f\u00fcr Android (>=97) Quellen: caniuse.com , blog.mozilla.org WebAuthn funktioniert auch ohne Internetverbindung. Was passiert mit meinem registrierten Fido Security Key nach dem Update von U2F auf WebAuthn? \u00b6 Warning Mit dem neuen U2F-Ersatz (WebAuthn) m\u00fcssen Sie Ihren Fido Security Key neu registrieren, zum Gl\u00fcck ist WebAuthn abw\u00e4rtskompatibel und unterst\u00fctzt das U2F-Protokoll. Im Idealfall sollten Sie beim n\u00e4chsten Einloggen (mit dem Schl\u00fcssel) ein Textfeld erhalten, das besagt, dass Ihr Fido Security Key aufgrund des Updates auf WebAuthn entfernt und als 2-Faktor-Authentifikator gel\u00f6scht wurde. Aber keine Sorge! Sie k\u00f6nnen Ihren bestehenden Schl\u00fcssel einfach neu registrieren und ihn wie gewohnt verwenden. Sie werden wahrscheinlich nicht einmal einen Unterschied bemerken, au\u00dfer dass Ihr Browser die U2F-Deaktivierungsmeldung nicht mehr anzeigt. Deaktivieren inoffizieller unterst\u00fctzter Fido Security Keys \u00b6 Mit WebAuthn gibt es die M\u00f6glichkeit, nur offizielle Fido Security Keys zu verwenden (von den gro\u00dfen Marken wie: Yubico, Apple, Nitro, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, usw.) zu verwenden. Dies dient in erster Linie der Sicherheit, da es Administratoren erm\u00f6glicht, sicherzustellen, dass nur offizielle Hardware in ihrer Umgebung verwendet werden kann. Um diese Funktion zu aktivieren, \u00e4ndern Sie den Wert WEBAUTHN_ONLY_TRUSTED_VENDORS in mailcow.conf von n auf y und starten Sie die betroffenen Container mit docker compose up -d neu. Die mailcow wird nun die Vendor-Zertifikate verwenden, die sich in Ihrem mailcow-Verzeichnis unter data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates befinden. Beispiel: \u00b6 Wenn Sie die offiziellen Hersteller-Ger\u00e4te nur auf Apple beschr\u00e4nken wollen, brauchen Sie nur das Apple Hersteller-Zertifikat im data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates . Nachdem Sie alle anderen Zertifikate gel\u00f6scht haben, k\u00f6nnen Sie WebAuthn 2FA nur noch mit Apple-Ger\u00e4ten aktivieren. Das ist f\u00fcr jeden Hersteller gleich, also w\u00e4hlen Sie aus, was Ihnen gef\u00e4llt (wenn Sie es wollen). Eigene Zertifikate f\u00fcr WebAuthn verwenden \u00b6 Wenn du ein g\u00fcltiges Zertifikat vom Hersteller deines Schl\u00fcssels hast, kannst du es auch zu deiner Mailcow hinzuf\u00fcgen! Kopieren Sie einfach das Zertifikat in den data/web/inc/lib/WebAuthn/rootCertificates Ordner und starten Sie Ihre Mailcow neu. Nun sollten Sie in der Lage sein, auch dieses Ger\u00e4t zu registrieren, obwohl die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung f\u00fcr die Herstellerzertifikate aktiviert ist, da Sie das Zertifikat manuell hinzugef\u00fcgt haben. Ist es gef\u00e4hrlich, den Vendor Check deaktiviert zu lassen? \u00b6 Nein, das ist es nicht! Diese Herstellerzertifikate werden nur zur \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der Originalhardware verwendet, nicht zur Absicherung des Registrierungsprozesses. Wie Sie in diesen Artikeln lesen k\u00f6nnen, hat die Deaktivierung nichts mit der Software-Sicherheit zu tun: - https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Attestation_and_Metadata/ - https://medium.com/webauthnworks/webauthn-fido2-demystifying-attestation-and-mds-efc3b3cb3651 - https://medium.com/webauthnworks/sorting-fido-ctap-webauthn-terminology-7d32067c0b01 Letztendlich ist es aber nat\u00fcrlich Ihre Entscheidung, ob Sie dieses H\u00e4kchen deaktiviert oder aktiviert lassen.

Sie haben zwei verschiedene Methoden, um TOTP f\u00fcr Ihr Konto zu registrieren: 1. Scannen Sie den QR-Code mit Ihrer Authenticator App auf einem Smartphone oder Tablet. 2. Verwenden Sie den TOTP-Code (unter dem QR-Code) in Ihrem TOTP-Programm oder Ihrer App (wenn Sie keinen QR-Code scannen k\u00f6nnen).

Dies ist wichtig, wenn Sie sich entscheiden, einen Proxy innerhalb von Docker zu verwenden. WICHTIG: Verwenden Sie nicht Port 8081, 9081 oder 65510! Erzeugen Sie die betroffenen Container neu, indem Sie docker compose up -d ausf\u00fchren. Wichtige Informationen, bitte lesen Sie diese sorgf\u00e4ltig durch!

Warning Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie generate_config.sh ausf\u00fchren, bevor Sie die untenstehenden Konfigurationsbeispiele aktivieren. Das Skript generate_config.sh kopiert die Snake-oil Zertifikate an den richtigen Ort, so dass die Dienste nicht aufgrund fehlender Dateien nicht starten k\u00f6nnen. Warning Wenn Sie TLS SNI aktivieren ( ENABLE_TLS_SNI in mailcow.conf), m\u00fcssen die Zertifikatspfade in Ihrem Reverse-Proxy mit den korrekten Pfaden in data/assets/ssl/{hostname} \u00fcbereinstimmen. Die Zertifikate werden in data/assets/ssl/{hostname1,hostname2,etc} aufgeteilt und werden daher nicht funktionieren, wenn Sie die Beispiele von unten kopieren, die auf data/assets/ssl/cert.pem etc. zeigen. Info Die Verwendung der untenstehenden Site-Konfigurationen wird acme-Anfragen an mailcow weiterleiten und es die Zertifikate selbst verwalten lassen. Der Nachteil der Verwendung von mailcow als ACME-Client hinter einem Reverse-Proxy ist, dass Sie Ihren Webserver neu laden m\u00fcssen, nachdem acme-mailcow das Zertifikat ge\u00e4ndert/erneuert/erstellt hat. Sie k\u00f6nnen entweder Ihren Webserver t\u00e4glich neu laden oder ein Skript schreiben, um die Datei auf \u00c4nderungen zu \u00fcberwachen. Auf vielen Servern wird logrotate den Webserver sowieso t\u00e4glich neu laden.

In diesem Abschnitt gehen wir davon aus, dass Sie Ihren Traefik 2 [certificatesresolvers] in Ihrer Traefik-Konfigurationsdatei richtig konfiguriert haben und auch acme verwenden.

Zuallererst werden wir den acme-mailcow-Container deaktivieren, da wir die von traefik bereitgestellten Zertifikate verwenden werden. Dazu m\u00fcssen wir SKIP_LETS_ENCRYPT=y in unserer mailcow.conf setzen und docker compose up -d ausf\u00fchren, um die \u00c4nderungen zu \u00fcbernehmen.

Dieser Container \u00fcberwacht die Datei acme.json auf \u00c4nderungen und generiert die Dateien cert.pem und key.pem direkt in data/assets/ssl/ , wobei der Pfad mit dem /output -Pfad des Containers verbunden ist.

Stellen Sie sicher, dass keine andere Anwendung die Konfiguration von mailcow st\u00f6rt, wie z.B. ein anderer Maildienst Ein korrektes DNS-Setup ist entscheidend f\u00fcr jedes gute Mailserver-Setup, also stellen Sie bitte sicher, dass Sie zumindest die basics abgedeckt haben, bevor Sie beginnen! Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr System ein korrektes Datum und eine korrekte Zeiteinstellung hat. Dies ist entscheidend f\u00fcr verschiedene Komponenten wie die Zwei-Faktor-TOTP-Authentifizierung.

Sie k\u00f6nnen diese in der mailcow.conf durch die Einstellungen SKIP_CLAMD=y und SKIP_SOLR=y jedoch auch deaktivieren. Info Wir sind uns bewusst, dass ein reiner MTA auf 128 MiB RAM laufen kann. mailcow ist eine ausgewachsene und gebrauchsfertige Groupware mit vielen Extras, die das Leben einfacher machen. Diese kommt mit einem Webserver, Webmailer, ActiveSync (MS), Antivirus, Antispam, Indexierung (Solr), Dokumentenscanner (Oletools), SQL (MariaDB), Cache (Redis), MDA, MTA, verschiedenen Webdiensten etc. Ein einzelner SOGo-Worker kann ~350 MiB RAM belegen, bevor er geleert wird. Je mehr ActiveSync-Verbindungen Sie verwenden m\u00f6chten, desto mehr RAM wird ben\u00f6tigt. In der Standardkonfiguration werden 20 Arbeiter erzeugt. Beispiele f\u00fcr die RAM Planung \u00b6 Ein Unternehmen mit 15 Smartphones (EAS aktiviert) und etwa 50 gleichzeitigen IMAP-Verbindungen sollte 16 GiB RAM einplanen. 6 GiB RAM + 1 GiB Swap sind f\u00fcr die meisten privaten Installationen ausreichend, w\u00e4hrend 8 GiB RAM f\u00fcr ~5 bis 10 Benutzer empfohlen werden. Im Rahmen unseres Supports k\u00f6nnen wir Ihnen bei der korrekten Planung Ihres Setups helfen. Unterst\u00fctzte Betriebssysteme \u00b6 Wir empfehlen, jede Distribution zu verwenden, die von Docker CE unterst\u00fctzt wird (siehe https://docs.docker.com/install/ ).

Sie sollten es deaktivieren (wenn m\u00f6glich) und stattdessen Ihren Regelsatz in die DOCKER-USER-Kette verschieben, die nicht durch einen Neustart des Docker-Dienstes gel\u00f6scht wird. Siehe diese (blog.donnex.net) oder diese (unrouted.io) Anleitung f\u00fcr Informationen dar\u00fcber, wie man iptables-persistent mit der DOCKER-USER Kette benutzt.

Eine wesentliche Bedingung ist, dass mailcow und Mailman in ihren eigenen Installationen f\u00fcr unabh\u00e4ngige Updates erhalten bleiben. Es gibt einige Anleitungen und Projekte im Internet, aber sie sind nicht auf dem neuesten Stand und/oder unvollst\u00e4ndig in der Dokumentation oder Konfiguration. Diese Anleitung basiert auf der Arbeit von: mailcow-mailman3-dockerized von Shadowghost mailman-mailcow-integration Nach Beendigung dieser Anleitung werden mailcow-dockerized und docker-mailman laufen und Apache als Reverse-Proxy wird die Web-Frontends bedienen. Das verwendete Betriebssystem ist ein Ubuntu 20.04 LTS .

Nachdem diese Einrichtung abgeschlossen ist, f\u00fcgen Sie eine weitere Subdomain f\u00fcr Mailman hinzu, z.B. lists.example.org , die auf denselben Server zeigt: # Name Typ Wert lists IN A 1.2.3.4 lists IN AAAA dead:beef Installieren Sie Apache als Reverse Proxy \u00b6 Installieren Sie Apache , z.B. mit dieser Anleitung von Digital Ocean : How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 20.04 (Englisch) . Aktivieren Sie bestimmte Apache Module (als root oder sudo ): a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http headers ssl wsgi proxy_uwsgi http2 M\u00f6glicherweise m\u00fcssen Sie weitere Pakete installieren, um diese Module zu erhalten. Dieses PPA von Ond\u0159ej Sur\u00fd k\u00f6nnte Ihnen helfen. vHost-Konfiguration \u00b6 Kopieren Sie die mailcow.conf und die mailman.conf in den Apache conf Ordner sites-available (z.B. unter /etc/apache2/sites-available ). \u00c4nderung in mailcow.conf : - MAILCOW_HOSTNAME zu Ihrem MAILCOW_HOSTNAME \u00c4nderung in mailman.conf : - MAILMAN_DOMAIN in Ihre Mailman -Domain (z.B.

Fr\u00fchere Versionen funktionieren grunds\u00e4tzlich, aber nach dem Einloggen sehen Sie keine E-Mails, die von oder an den Domain-Alias gesendet werden. (z.B. wenn @example.com ein Alias f\u00fcr admin@example.com ist) Das zu l\u00f6sende Problem \u00b6 mailpiler bietet die Authentifizierung auf Basis von IMAP an, zum Beispiel: $config['ENABLE_IMAP_AUTH'] = 1; $config['IMAP_HOST'] = 'mail.example.com'; $config['IMAP_PORT'] = 993; $config['IMAP_SSL'] = true; Wenn Sie sich also mit patrik@example.com anmelden, sehen Sie nur zugestellte E-Mails, die von oder an diese spezielle E-Mail-Adresse gesendet wurden.

Indem wir uns in den Authentifizierungsprozess von mailpiler einklinken, sind wir in der Lage, die erforderlichen Daten \u00fcber die mailcow API w\u00e4hrend des Logins zu erhalten. Dies l\u00f6st API-Anfragen an die mailcow-API aus (die einen Nur-Lese-API-Zugang erfordern), um die Aliase auszulesen, an denen Ihre E-Mail-Adresse teilnimmt, und auch den \"Namen\" des Postfachs, der angegeben wurde, um ihn nach dem Login oben rechts in mailpiler anzuzeigen. Zugelassene E-Mail-Adressen k\u00f6nnen in den Mailpiler-Einstellungen oben rechts nach dem Einloggen eingesehen werden. Info Dies wird nur einmal w\u00e4hrend des Authentifizierungsprozesses abgefragt. Die autorisierten Aliase und der Realname sind f\u00fcr die gesamte Dauer der Benutzersitzung g\u00fcltig, da mailpiler sie in den Sitzungsdaten setzt. Wird ein Benutzer aus einem bestimmten Alias entfernt, so wird dies erst nach dem n\u00e4chsten Login wirksam.
