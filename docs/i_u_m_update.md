## Automatic update

An update script in your mailcow-dockerized directory will take care of updates.

But use it with caution! If you think you made a lot of changes to the mailcow code, you should use the manual update guide below.

Run the update script:
```
./update.sh
```

If it needs to, it will ask you how you wish to proceed.
Merge errors will be reported.
Some minor conflicts will be auto-corrected (in favour for the mailcow: dockerized repository code).

### Options

```
# Options can be combined

# - Check for updates and show changes
./update.sh --check

# Do not try to update docker-compose, **make sure to use the latest docker-compose available**
./update.sh --no-update-compose

# - Do not start mailcow after applying an update
./update.sh --skip-start

# - Force update (unattended, but unsupported, use at own risk)
./update.sh --force

# - Run garbage collector to cleanup old image tags and exit
./update.sh --gc

# - Update with merge strategy option "ours" instead of "theirs"
#   This will **solve conflicts** when merging in favor for your local changes and should be avoided. Local changes will always be kept, unless we changed file XY, too.
./update.sh --ours

# - Don't update, but prefetch images and exit
./update.sh --prefetch
```

### I forgot what I changed before running update.sh

See `git log --pretty=oneline | grep -i "before update"`, you will have an output similar to this:

```
22cd00b5e28893ef9ddef3c2b5436453cc5223ab Before update on 2020-09-28_19_25_45
dacd4fb9b51e9e1c8a37d84485b92ffaf6c59353 Before update on 2020-08-07_13_31_31
```

Run `git diff 22cd00b5e28893ef9ddef3c2b5436453cc5223ab` to see what changed.

### Can I roll back?

Yes.

See the topic above, instead of a diff, you run checkout:

```
docker-compose down
# Replace commit ID 22cd00b5e28893ef9ddef3c2b5436453cc5223ab by your ID
git checkout 22cd00b5e28893ef9ddef3c2b5436453cc5223ab
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Hooks

You can hook into the update mechanism by adding scripts called `pre_commit_hook.sh` and `post_commit_hook.sh` to your mailcows root directory. See [this](./u_e-update-hooks.md) for more details.

## Footnotes

- There is no release cycle regarding updates.
