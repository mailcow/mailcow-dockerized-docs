Watchdog uses default values for all thresholds defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

The default values will work for most setups.
Example:
```
- NGINX_THRESHOLD=${NGINX_THRESHOLD:-5}
- UNBOUND_THRESHOLD=${UNBOUND_THRESHOLD:-5}
- REDIS_THRESHOLD=${REDIS_THRESHOLD:-5}
- MYSQL_THRESHOLD=${MYSQL_THRESHOLD:-5}
- MYSQL_REPLICATION_THRESHOLD=${MYSQL_REPLICATION_THRESHOLD:-1}
- SOGO_THRESHOLD=${SOGO_THRESHOLD:-3}
- POSTFIX_THRESHOLD=${POSTFIX_THRESHOLD:-8}
- CLAMD_THRESHOLD=${CLAMD_THRESHOLD:-15}
- DOVECOT_THRESHOLD=${DOVECOT_THRESHOLD:-12}
- DOVECOT_REPL_THRESHOLD=${DOVECOT_REPL_THRESHOLD:-20}
- PHPFPM_THRESHOLD=${PHPFPM_THRESHOLD:-5}
- RATELIMIT_THRESHOLD=${RATELIMIT_THRESHOLD:-1}
- FAIL2BAN_THRESHOLD=${FAIL2BAN_THRESHOLD:-1}
- ACME_THRESHOLD=${ACME_THRESHOLD:-1}
- RSPAMD_THRESHOLD=${RSPAMD_THRESHOLD:-5}
- OLEFY_THRESHOLD=${OLEFY_THRESHOLD:-5}
- MAILQ_THRESHOLD=${MAILQ_THRESHOLD:-20}
- MAILQ_CRIT=${MAILQ_CRIT:-30}
```

To adjust them just add necessary threshold variables (e.g. `MAILQ_THRESHOLD=10`) to `mailcow.conf` and run the following command:

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
