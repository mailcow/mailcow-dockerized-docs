Since February the 28th 2017 mailcow does come with port 80 and 443 enabled.

**Do not use the config below for reverse proxy setups**, please see our [reverse proxy guide](../post_installation/firststeps-rp.md) for this, which includes a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.

Open `mailcow.conf` and set `HTTP_BIND=` - if not already set.

Create a new file `data/conf/nginx/redirect.conf` and add the following server config to the file:

```
server {
  root /web;
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/server_name.active;
  if ( $request_uri ~* "%0A|%0D" ) { return 403; }
  location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    allow all;
    default_type "text/plain";
  }
  location / {
    return 301 https://$host$uri$is_args$args;
  }
}
```

In case you changed the HTTP_BIND parameter, recreate the container:

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Otherwise restart Nginx:

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose restart
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose restart
    ```
