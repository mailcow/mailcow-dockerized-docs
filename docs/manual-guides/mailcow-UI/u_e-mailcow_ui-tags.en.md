### What are Tags designed for?
With the Tags you can easily sort your Domains and Mailboxes by the tags instead of their name.

### Where are the Tags located?
The Tags are located in the Domain/Mailbox section of the mailcow UI.
To view them simply click on the small plus symbol on the left of your Domain/Mailbox (following picture is showing the domain ribbon menu):
![Domain/Mailbox Tags Ribbon](../../assets/images/manual-guides/mailcow-domain_tags_ribbon.png)


### How can i add/remove a Tag?
You can simply add/remove a Tag during the creation of a new Domain/Mailbox. You also can add/remove them if you edit your desired Domain/Mailbox.

It looks similar to this (following picture showing the domain edit section):

### How can i search for a tag?
Simply type the Tag Name in the search bar in the Domain/Mailbox Section and wait for it to complete.

You can even specify if you want to search for tags only.
