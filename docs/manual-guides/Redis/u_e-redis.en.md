Redis is used as a key-value store for rspamd's and (some of) mailcow's settings and data. If you are unfamiliar with redis please read the [introduction to redis](https://redis.io/topics/introduction) and maybe visit this [wonderful guide](http://try.redis.io/) on how to use it.

## Client

To connect to the redis cli execute:
=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    docker-compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    ```

### Debugging

Here are some useful commands for the redis-cli for debugging:

##### MONITOR

Listens for all requests received by the server in real time:
=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    #docker compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    127.0.0.1:6379> monitor
    OK
    1494077286.401963 [0 172.22.1.253:41228] "SMEMBERS" "BAYES_SPAM_keys"
    1494077288.292970 [0 172.22.1.253:41229] "SMEMBERS" "BAYES_SPAM_keys"
    [...]
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    #docker-compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    127.0.0.1:6379> monitor
    OK
    1494077286.401963 [0 172.22.1.253:41228] "SMEMBERS" "BAYES_SPAM_keys"
    1494077288.292970 [0 172.22.1.253:41229] "SMEMBERS" "BAYES_SPAM_keys"
    [...]
    ```

##### KEYS

Get all keys matching your pattern:

```
KEYS *
```

##### PING

Test a connection:

```
127.0.0.1:6379> PING
PONG
```
