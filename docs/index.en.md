**The mailserver suite with the 'moo'**

## What is mailcow: dockerized?

!!! question
	Mailcow, MailCow or mailcow? What is the exact name of the project?

	Correct: **mailcow**, because mailcow is a registered word mark with a small m :grin:

mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker.

mailcow relies on many well known and long used components, which in combination result in an all around carefree email server.

Each container represents a single application, connected in a bridged network:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :simple-letsencrypt: [__ACME__](https://letsencrypt.org/) Automatic generation of Let's Encrypt certificates
- :fontawesome-solid-file-shield: [__ClamAV__](https://www.clamav.net/) Antivirus scanner (optional)
- :simple-dovecot: [__Dovecot__](https://www.dovecot.org/) IMAP/POP server for retrieving e-mails with integrated Full-Text Search Engine ["Flatcurve"](https://slusarz.github.io/dovecot-fts-flatcurve/)
- :simple-mariadb: [__MariaDB__](https://mariadb.org/) Database for storing user information etc.
- :fontawesome-solid-memory: [__Memcached__](https://www.memcached.org/) Cache for the webmailer SOGo
- :fontawesome-solid-ban: __Netfilter__ Fail2ban-like integration of [@mkuron](https://github.com/mkuron)

- :simple-php: [__PHP__](https://php.net/) Programming language of most web-based mailcow applications
- :material-email-newsletter: [__Postfix__](http://www.postfix.org/) MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) for e-mail traffic on the Internet
- :simple-redis: [__Redis__](https://redis.io/) Storage for spam information, DKIM key, etc.

</div>

But the heart of mailcow is the graphical web interface, the **mailcow UI**.

It offers a place for almost all settings and allows the comfortable creation of new domains and email addresses with just a few clicks.

But also other or more tricky tasks can be done in it with ease:

- [DKIM](http://dkim.org) and [ARC](http://arc-spec.org/) support/generation.
- Black and white lists per domain and per user.
- Spam score management per user (reject spam, flag spam, greylist).
- Allow mailbox users to create temporary spam aliases
- Prepend email tags to subject or move emails to subfolders (per user)
- Allow mailbox users to toggle TLS enforcement for inbound and outbound messages
- Users can reset caches on SOGo ActiveSync devices
- imapsync to periodically migrate or retrieve remote mailboxes
- TFA: Yubikey OTP and WebAuthn USB (Google Chrome and derivatives only), TOTP
- Add whitelist hosts to forward mail to mailcow
- Fail2ban-like integration
- Quarantine system
- Anti-virus scanning including macro scanning in Office documents
- Integrated basic monitoring
- And much more...

The mailcow data (such as emails, user data, etc.) is stored in **Docker volumes** - take good care of these volumes:

- clamd-db-vol-1
- crypt-vol-1
- mysql-socket-vol-1
- mysql-vol-1
- postfix-vol-1
- redis-vol-1
- rspamd-vol-1
- sogo-userdata-backup-vol-1
- sogo-web-vol-1
- vmail-index-vol-1
- vmail-vol-1

!!! warning
	The mails are compressed and encrypted. The key pair can be found in crypt-vol-1. Please don't forget to backup this and other volumes. #nobackupnopity
