## What is eM Client?

**eM Client** is a versatile email application for Windows, macOS, Android and Apple iOS known for its user-friendly interface and wide range of features. In addition to sending and receiving emails, eM Client also supports calendars, contacts, tasks, and chat. It is suitable for both private users and businesses looking for an alternative to Outlook or Thunderbird. With built-in support for IMAP, SMTP, and CardDAV/CalDAV, it integrates easily with most email servers.

One of the standout features is its **plug-and-play compatibility[^1] with mailcow and SOGo**: eM Client automatically detects the appropriate calendar and contact services, allowing seamless integration with just a single click — no need for ActiveSync.
