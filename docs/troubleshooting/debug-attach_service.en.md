## Attaching a Container to your Shell

To attach a container to your shell you can simply run

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose exec $Dienst_Name /bin/bash
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
	docker-compose exec $Dienst_Name /bin/bash
    ```

### Connecting to Services

If you want to connect to a service / application directly it is always a good idea to `source mailcow.conf` to get all relevant variables into your environment.

#### MySQL

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    source mailcow.conf
    docker compose exec mysql-mailcow mysql -u${DBUSER} -p${DBPASS} ${DBNAME}
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    source mailcow.conf
    docker-compose exec mysql-mailcow mysql -u${DBUSER} -p${DBPASS} ${DBNAME}
    ```

#### Redis

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
	docker-compose exec redis-mailcow redis-cli
    ```
