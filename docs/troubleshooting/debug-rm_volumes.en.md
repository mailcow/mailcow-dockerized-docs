You may want to remove a set of persistent data to resolve a conflict or to start over.

`mailcowdockerized` can vary and depends on your compose project name (if it's unchanged, `mailcowdockerized` is the correct value). If you are unsure about volume names, run `docker volume ls` for a full list.

Delete a single volume:

```
docker volume rm mailcowdockerized_${VOLUME_NAME}
```

- Remove volume `mysql-vol-1` to remove all MySQL data.
- Remove volume `redis-vol-1` to remove all Redis data.
- Remove volume `vmail-vol-1` to remove all contents of `/var/vmail` mounted to `dovecot-mailcow`.
- Remove volume `rspamd-vol-1` to remove all Rspamd data.
- Remove volume `crypt-vol-1` to remove all crypto data. This will render **all mails** unreadable.

Alternatively, running the following command will **destroy all mailcow: dockerized volumes** and delete any related containers and networks:

=== "docker compose (Plugin)"

    ``` bash
    docker compose down -v
    ```

=== "docker-compose (Standalone)"

    ``` bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
